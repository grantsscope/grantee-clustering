 Cosmos for Humanity is a [non-profit NGO based in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland](https://cosmosforhumanity.eu/en). We aim to defend an environmentally and economically sustainable access to outer space for humanity. Faced with the problem of space pollutions and space debris, we are all responsible: governments and the space industry, but also us, citizens and companies.

 Today, without us really being aware of it, humanity tends to depend on satellites as much as it depends on electricity: [if tomorrow all satellites disappeared](https://youtu.be/jVzbs81bDy0), our civilization would falter.
 
 
 
 
 
 Similarly, our efforts to combat global warming and the pursuit of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals [depend on our satellite capabilities](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/space4sdgs/index.html): it is now essential to maintain them.

 # What are our missions ?
 
 
 
 1. Develop an indicator (the Outer Space Footprint - OSF) that allows to evaluate the environmental impact of the use of satellite data on the whole value chain: from launchers and satellites operators to end-users, citizens and companies. This indicator is currently being designed in partnership with CNES (the French space agency).
 
  
 
 2. Fund the development of an ecosystem dedicated to the sustainable development of space activities. Researchers and startups are currently struggling to find funding because space sustainability is not ""hype"" or ""profitable"" at the moment. We need to help them.
 
  
 
 3. Promote the incorporation of orbit protection as the 7th EU environmental objective so that OSF documentation is made mandatory for European companies ([NFRD / CSRD directives](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en)) and that sustainable space activities are considered as ""sustainable activities"" in the sense of the [European Green Taxonomy](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance/tools-and-standards/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en).

 --------------------------
 
 
 
 # Our long term objectives :
 
 
 
 1. Advocating widespread adoption of the Outer Space Footprint
 
 
 
 2. Create a citizen-led eco-label dedicated to studying the outer space environmental impact of companies. Our goal is to create a new way of looking at consumer labels, without the use of trusted third parties and in particular auditing firms [that have conflicts of interest with companies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/26/blue-ticked-off-the-controversy-over-the-msc-fish-ecolabel).
 
  
 
 
 
 ----------------------------------
 
 
 
 # What we will do next :
 
 
 
 - Lobbying space agencies and companies in Europe to promote the OSF as a tool for achieving a pivot towards more sustainable development of space activities.
 
 
 
 - Continue to create educational content to make English-language studies on ""Space as a Commons"" accessible to French-, German- and Italian-speaking communities, in order to develop the ReFi x DeSpace community in Switzerland, France, Germany and Italy.

 The Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale. Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.
 
 
 
 Introduction
 
 The town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000 hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.
 
 
 
 What Has Been Accomplished 
 
 We successfully raised $21,000 in the previous gitcoin round (GR15), $14,000 in the alpha round, and $8,000 in the beta round. With these funds we have made considerable progress in setting up a territorial foundation capable to oversee this territorial-scale regenerative work while supporting all of the projects listed above. 
 
 
 
 Projects we are supporting include:
 
 
 
 1. The Center for Syntropic Agroforestry to establish demonstration sites, train local farmers, and share technical knowledge about this powerful approach to reforestation and economic development.
 
 
 
 2. A community kitchen and store called Casa Comun that prototypes alternative economic models and hosts local exchanges among more than 80 local producers in the community.
 
 
 
 3. A community reforestation project called Bioparque M√≥ncora that is a highly visible symbol of peace, reforestation, and ecological education that works with area schools and national universities.
 
 
 
 4. The construction of a community theater called Caney Colibri where children learn the art of storytelling, filmmaking, and the performing arts ‚Äì all in service to regeneration of the territory.
 
 
 
 5. The Origen del Agua Nature Reserve that is reforesting 3.2 hectares of heavily degraded land with native plant species while working with a local school to bring campesino children into the learning process.
 
 
 
 With funds that we raise during this gitcoin round, we will continue weaving this tapestry of local projects and sharing what we learn with the rest of the world through the Design School for Regenerating Earth and a variety of social media channels.
 
 
 
 Vision
 
 All the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.

 BRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others‚Äô experiences. He is also co-founder alongside Penny Heiple and Benji Ross of the Design School for Regenerating Earth.

Learn more at [links.gainforest.earth](https://links.gainforest.earth)
 
 
 
 # Conservation Basic Income for the Global South
 
 
 
 If tropical deforestation would be a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world (after China and the US). To adhere to the 1.5-degree target set by the Paris Agreement, we need to halt global deforestation immediately. GainForest has built a global and **trusted network of conservation organisations (23 and counting)** that protect and reforest critical ecosystems. Explore our green globe at [maps.gainforest.app](https://maps.gainforest.app).
 
 
 
 ![](https://imgur.com/s4rPU5m.gif)
 
 
 
 Rather than relying on donations, we are developing a **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that employs community-operated conservation drones** to employ local communities to gather vast amounts of machine learning-ready forest data. Local communities are rewarded for their efforts in digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV). In previous trial runs, we compensated individuals 50 cents for every tree measured, with a daily income cap of 10 USD per community member.
 
 
 
 Our objective is to scale these efforts, providing additionally low-cost conservation drones on loan and compensate local communities 5-10 USD for each drone mapping mission they undertake.
 
 
 
 # Why paying for data is the way forward in nature conservation
 
 
 
 ![](https://imgur.com/9N99GhR.png)
 
 
 
 Carbon credits often lack transparency and are susceptible to exploitation. Similarly, donations can be challenging to maintain consistently. At GainForest, we are convinced that data payments are the key to creating a reliable income source for local communities.
 
 
 
 Data regarding biodiversity in the Global South is scarce. Many species of plants and animals in these regions remain undiscovered and not documented. A conservation-focused data collection initiative would create a global data commons, propelling **the advancement of AI and biodiversity research in these areas**. There's an immediate need and a broad consensus to compensate local data collectors for their contributions.
 
 
 
 In our DePIN system, drone-captured images are validated through similarity analysis with publicly accessible satellite imagery (read our https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2020/23). In addition, **a network of neighboring local communities** serves as a verifier for the authenticity of the data.
 
 
 
 **Conservation Basic Income Payments** are then distributed for every drone-composed mosaic and tree image contributed by community members.
 
 
 
 # NFTrees: Dynamic Hypercerts for Forest Conservation

 Data gatherers and financiers receive **NFTree hypercerts**, interactive digital NFT replicas of the collected data, which monitor a holder's credibility, data integrity, and contribution to Decentralized Science (DeSci). This system opens up opportunities for data licensing, collective action, and retrospective funding.""

 Yaupon Tea Co. is a radically sustainable local tea company based in Wilmington, North Carolina, USA, focused on providing to the world the many wonders of Yaupon Holly, North America's only native caffeinated plant.
 
 
 
 We seek to educate the public about the many ecological, economic, and health benefits of its widespread use and re-adoption. This is done by creating the most natural, healthy, and sustainable products possible, and through regenerative practices, community involvement, and educational workshops.
 
  
 
 
 
 Community Yaupon Supplier Program
 
 
 
 Beyond selling yaupon tea, we are working to enable the creation, exchange, and retirement of blockchain verified carbon and eco credits, derived from the tangible ecological benefits of our community yaupon supplier program. 
 
 
 
 This ongoing community supplier program enables local land stewards (farmers, land managers, and landowners) here in the southeastern US to benefit both financially and ecologically from the sustainable harvesting and management of their yaupon holly, often considered a nuisance crop due to its excessive growth. 
 
 
 
 While this program already allows for our suppliers to benefit ecologically from the various positive ecosystem services provided through sustainable yaupon holly management (i.e increased water, soil, and air quality, as well as improved biodiversity and carbon sequestration potential), we aim for them to benefit economically as well through the sale of associated carbon and eco credits. 
 
 
 
 
 
 GIS Habitat Analysis Tool
 
 
 
 This will be done with the help of our GIS Habitat Analysis tool, which will enable us to better record the positive ecosystem benefits of sustainable yaupon growth and management, using a combination of GIS/remote sensing, drone, and ground-truth data. 
 
 
 
 This open-source, web-based, GIS Habitat Analysis tool will allow us to record, analyze, and provide the necessary verifiable data required for the creation and sale of associated carbon/eco credits derived from our community supplier program, with the help of RegenNetwork and their carbon and eco credit marketplace. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Funding
 
 
 
 We are thus seeking funding to provide support for the development and deployment of our open-source GIS habitat Analysis Tool. This includes the purchase of specialized remote sensing drone hardware /software, along with ecological data collection equipment and staffing for continuous ground-truth data collection. 
 
 
 
 All the code for our GIS Habitat Analysis tool will be open-source via our Github, along with how we integrate with various web 3.0 infrastructure associated. 
 
 
 
 We believe this project can provide a necessary foundation and framework for other like-minded projects and organizations in the climate space seeking to reduce their carbon emissions and begin revaluing the many measurable benefits of healthy, naturally functioning ecological systems using open-source satellite and blockchain tech."

 RegenBuild aims to build the first decentralised, digital protocol to measure, report and validate building performance through all phases of a building‚Äôs lifecycle and provide funding access to qualified projects.
 
 
 
 The project consists of
 
 
 
 1. A regenerative standard for the built environment that pushes the status quo of existing green building rating systems and sets a higher bar for the industry.
 
 2. A platform to run analysis where existing products can plug in and provide validator services at various stages of the project.
 
 3. A protocol to align stakeholders, incentivise positive outcomes and equitably reward them with impact certificates and credits.
 
 
 
 Done right, the RegenBuild protocol could potentially serve as the foundation for the AECO industry‚Äôs transition to a regenerative paradigm over the 21st century.
 
 
 
 # **Mission**
 
 
 
 Our mission is to align the AECO industry and build public goods to solve coordination problems and accelerate regeneration in the built environment.

 # **Why are we doing this? The potential impact of RegenBuild**
 
 
 
 The built environment industry is responsible for around 40% of global carbon emissions, 30% of waste generation, and 20% of water consumption. It is imperative that we address the core issues of the industry to affect changes at a planetary scale and this project is an attempt to do that.
 
 
 
 ![construction industry emissions.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/03be014c-3d9e-4f94-a0e9-ee69ae30d453/construction_industry_emissions.png)
 
 
 
 The industry is notoriously difficult to coordinate because of the number of stakeholders involved, slow adoption of technology, financial accessibility, and data interoperability issues through all phases of a project‚Äôs lifecycle.
 
 
 
 Leveraging crypto-economic systems could prove critical in coordinating the stakeholders towards shared goals by incentivising positive outcomes. Building an open workflow and integrating it with existing workflows and products solves data interoperability problems and eases adoption. Connecting to DeFi funding protocols opens up new financial models and enables more projects to become regenerative.

 # To make this happen, $Earth has been designed to -
 
 
 
 1. Incentivize degens, regens, treegens and solarpunks to **purge their petro $$$ for $Earth** which has a floating, range bound currency design. $Earth holders then use Quadratic Voting to determine which verified projects get funded via the treasury.
 
 
 
 2. Inherently ascribing value to ecosystem services created by the projects we fund, by selling $Earth at a premium to the $ value of projects in the neoliberal world.
 
 
 
 $Earth acts as a **new unit of value** for the $ value of the projects in our treasury + potential yields these projects will generate + the positive externalities created by these projects ( healthy soil, carbon sequestration, clean air, biodiversity etc) + solarpunk values it manifests
 
 
 
 3. Generating utility for $Earth by creating a **network of regenerative/solarpunk merchants** who are willing to provide their goods and services in exchange of $Earth.
 
 
 
 # Due to your incredible support in the Beta round where we managed to come 4th from 102 participants we were able to -

 2,500+ children receive scholastic materials every year
 
 7 wetlands have been restored
 
 765 girls and women have been trained on making reusable sanitary towels
 
 The funds we received from the Gitcoin Beta Round are being used for the reconstruction of our nursery bed/greenhouse. The nursery was constructed with wood poles that have been destroyed by termites, and we are replacing them with metal poles that will last longer. In addition, the funds help us to continue to plant fruit trees in schools, health centers and churches, as well as to train farmers and run climate awareness and education campaigns.
 
 For GG18, we request that with your support, we would love to start a community skilling center and demonstration farm. Our vision is that by next year, many of our Gitcoin supporters can visit our farm and recommend interns for our organization.
 
 
 
 # Problem #
 
 ![ClimateChangeBanner](https://ayoweccauganda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot_20221004-094748_1.jpg)
 
 Climate change is a fact, and it is widely acknowledged that the world is in the midst of a global warming crisis. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and land use change have released greenhouse gas (GHG) into the atmosphere, which is the primary driver of recent climate change. Land use such as agriculture alone, discharges more than 6 billion metric tons of GHG into the atmosphere each year. Because of the increased severity of climate change impacts in some areas, the consequences have been more severe and disastrous.
 
 In Uganda, Climate change is a serious problem, affecting livelihoods. The country experiences prolonged drought, short and erratic rains which are disastrous and affect agricultural production, the backbone of the country. Also, due to disparities in traditional roles, societal expectations, and livelihoods, men and women are affected differently by climate change. Women account for the bulk of Uganda's population of 23.19 million people. They have lower wages, less access to credit and decision-making power, and less control over resources, all of which make them more vulnerable to climate change. It‚Äôs therefore important to consider differences when tackling the issue of climate change.

 # Solution #
 
 Agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture has emerged as a major instrument in the fight against climate change in recent years. It's a widely accepted answer to the twin problems of climate change and food insecurity. It's one of a number of innovative strategies targeted at increasing production while also assisting in the mitigation of climate change by increasing carbon sequestration and boosting the system's ability to cope with the negative consequences of climate change.
 
 This project aims to promote agroforestry/permaculture/regenerative agriculture for climate change mitigation and the development of vulnerable groups' livelihoods, such as women, by planting fruit trees alongside food crops
 
 Over the past decades wetlands are seen as wastelands yet wetlands play a crucial role as far as regulating our climate system. Our climatic system is significantly regulated by wetland ecosystems. They serve as a large sink for greenhouse gases, trapping carbon and preventing it from entering the atmosphere, but they can also act as sources of some GHGs, particularly methane (CH4) when disturbed which increases climate change. Without neglecting the myriad ecosystem services they offer, wetlands protect against flooding, provide habitat for fish and shellfish reproduction and rearing, and support ecotourism, source of food like fish, cultural heritage and local herbs, to mention a few.
 
 We used to have two seasons for rainfall when I was growing up. But as a result of climate change, we now suffer unpredictable shorter or longer rainy seasons as well as severe droughts. Wetlands have been destroyed, bird and tree species have vanished, there have been extreme weather events in various parts of Uganda,as a result of the effects of climate change and environmental destruction, all of which are a result of human activity.

 At AYOWECCA UGANDA, we train rural farmers on regenerative agricultural methods/smart agriculture that are environmentally sustainable, mapping agricultural practices in carbon credits. promoting agroforestry and permaculture where farmers can plant fruit trees besides growing food or cash crops, learn how to make organic manure and pesticides.
 
 Besides that we have a charity which works in communities as a sign of (mobilization), climate change awareness and education, crypto education, tree planting and wetlands and peatland restoration campaigns, workshops, storytelling, giving seeds to farmers.

 We are a movement of people building a rooted narrative that incentivizes food, forest and culture. We believe that regeneration is not just a measure of forest cover or sequestred carbon. In our view, regeneration also involves food sovereignty and cultural connection with natural resources. 
 
 
 
 Seasonal management of intergenerational food forests should be part of our societies lifes, should be a career anyone can choose to engage, directly or indirectly. In fact that's how it was a few centuries ago in many human tribes. However, In the modern era, we went from community-oriented to market-oriented agriculture, and the many values involved in this activity were reduced only to financial value. The community engagement was reduced to individual farmer investment and risk taking, which rarely pays off, so it's better to move to the city, and so the rural exodus started.
 
 
 
 We now live in a time of packed cities and empty fields, a dichotomy between urban and rural. Many of us are tired of this way of living and want to change, often taking some permaculture course, saving money to buy a land and becoming a neo rural, having to start from zero, with no intergenerational legacy and with no community support. 
 
 
 
 Our goal is to build the web3 trails that can support the emergence of a blended urban/rural global society of food forest commoners. Where anyone from their own apartment can have shares in supply chains, join training and experiences in the agrifood sector, be supported, recognized, rewarded for the engagement and grow older together with their pet food forests. People with their belly full are harder to be exploited, as Kropotkin says, and if we can share a global agenda of seasonal food forest harvests and activities, share seeds and experiences we can have a bit more piece of mind, a bit more food sovereignty, and know that our kids and grandkids can inherit the rooted wealth we create.

 Commoning around food cultivated by the AgroforestDAO community during our side event at ETH Rio
 
 
 
 We are fundraising to continue on the ground experiments that co-produce food and forests, contextualizing the process in order to make it easy to comprehend by other local stewards and the global community. We are also testing strategies and tools for governance (Wonderverse.xyz), tracking (Spatial), and voucher sales (RWA NFTs).
 
 
 
 
 
 ## How we used the funds raised in previous rounds:
 
 
 
 ### Building a Treasure
 
 We are saving part the funds in our multisig, with the goal of supporting new local stewards once we have the web3 trails ready to go. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Feij√£o Amigo NFT Collection
 
 
 
 [![nft-feijaoamigo-batchcocricaocolheita-696x610.png](https://i.postimg.cc/jjMFNp3F/nft-feijaoamigo-batchcocricaocolheita-696x610.png)](https://postimg.cc/yJSjCbHm)
 
 
 
 
 
 During Q2 (Autumn in Brazil) we launched a NFT campaign to test a model to forward finance the production of 1 acre of beans. The Feij√£o Amigo collection was a way to buy a share of the beans production before the harvest, thus taking part of the risk together with the local steward, allowing him to focus solely on agriculture for the community and not having to worry about markets. 
 
 
 
 With the NFT sales we managed to fund 25% of the costs, and the rest was paid by the funds received during the Gitcoin Alpha round.
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Metaverse
 
 
 
 
 
 [![colagem.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/v8cp7msL/colagem.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLvJBBL5)
 
 
 
 
 
 A metaverse exhibit was created and updated during every new activity on the cultivation, providing storytelling and contextualization space for the followers and allowing them to meet the stewards and understand the cultivation process. It was also connected with the metaverse created during NFT Brasil, the biggest web3 event in 2023: https://www.spatial.io/s/SAF-Morro-da-Redencao-Redemption-Hill-Bias-Fortes-MG-Brazil-642bf48f455b3cf31acabc13?share=3146598460728500605. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Web3 Conferences

 Speaking at NFT Brasil, about decentralized food sovereignty, June 2023
 
 
 
 
 
 Besides funding our first decentralized cultivation of beans, the Gitcoin Rounds funds also allowed AgroforestDAO to spread the word in Brazillian Web3 conferences from Q2-Q3, such as ETH Rio, NFT Brasil (S√£o Paulo), Hack Town (Minas Gerais) and host a side event dinner with local ingredients and other Regen web3 organizations in a coordinated effort called Regenerative Resources or ReRe.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## How will we use the funds from GR18
 
 
 
 The funds raised in this round will be used locally to buy seeds, seedlings, pay the costs of establishing a collective food forest and create a 3 years lease contract in the name of AgroforestDAO. It will also support a training program together with regional institutional offices of agriculture and forestry with the goal of building capacity within the local community for agroforestry management.
 
 
 
 The Spring/Summer intervention is a more complex challenge than the Autumn beans, because it involves a policulture of species organized in time and space, and therefore we will create different NFT collections for those willing to engage with the short term crops and/or the long term forest lines. 
 
 
 
 Beyond the local production goals, we also want to inform and make biodiverse agriculture more familiar for the web3 community, so we will share content with our followers and the Spring/Summer tasks in a task management tool called Wonderverse.xyz. Our goal is to build a model for future stewards share their 6-month plans and get reviewed by the DAO.
 
 NFT holders will have monthly updates in our gated exhibit on Spatial, will get a share of the harvests, invitations to our annual meetup and a ticket-pass to book a local experience on the land.
 
 
 
 We believe that it is possible to create new types of access to land and community-oriented agriculture, and thanks to the Gitcoin Community we are able to trail this unknown path. We are very thankful for your support and will be broadcasting our process, please connect with us, let‚Äôs build this together!"

 Introduction :
 
 The company AURUM41 LTD has launched its innovative and why not revolutionary proposal to tokenize unmined gold.
 
 
 
 This idea, which seems simple in its conception, has years of study and preparation behind it, and will undoubtedly be a path forward and a paradigm shift in traditional gold mining from now to the future.
 
 
 
 This is how ROELA was born, a security token backed by unmined gold, which, as they well explained during the presentation, aims to revolutionize the gold market based on a concept that seemed obvious, and that is to use the best vault that exists for its custody ( the earth). In this way, the company generates a product that can be used as a store of value, without the environmental consequences that exploitation generates.
 
 Our company does not intend to compete with traditional mining, although at first glance it seems so, in many cases we can be an ally for them, as evidenced by the different alliances we have with different mining companies, since gold mines are often unviable in terms of traditional exploitation given that the dispersion of gold makes the exploitation cost unprofitable. And also on farms where the socio-environmental impact makes them unfeasible. our company will allocate a percentage of the proceeds for the economic development of these communities,
 
 
 
 The commitment of our company is to be able to give back to the community, the opportunity that technology offers us.
 
 A mine involved in this project will never be exploited in traditional way.
 
 
 
  We know that we are marking a path that no one has traveled yet, that for our company is an enormous motivation and at the same time a great challenge.
 
 
 
 Today our company is registered in Gibraltar but we want to establish our startup in Portugal, in order to establish ourselves in a country of the EU community and we are convinced that Portugal is the best country for this. Today we are in the final stage of seeking the regulation for our security token. We have some mineral rights as company assets in three different countries.
 
 
 
 As we like to say... We can be considered a technology company with mineral rights or a mining company that applies technology...

 Mesoamerican Reef DAO (MesoReefDAO) is a Regenerative Coral Reef Science initiative that focuses on the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of DeSci (Decentralized Science) that seeks to scale coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR).
 
 The Mesoamerican Reef is indeed the second-largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 600 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras (Fig 1). It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.

 Fig 1. A map of the Mesoamerican Reef, ¬© WWF Guatemala.
 
 
 
 MesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).

 Fig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.
 
 
 
 **Mission** 
 
 The MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.
 
 
 
 **Vision**
 
 
 
 The MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats, improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.
 
 
 
 **Problem**
 
 
 
 The problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.
 
 
 
 However, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.

 Fig 3. Coral Outplanting areas in the Mexican Caribbean.
 
 
 
 **How?**
 
 
 
 MesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.
 
 
 
 The framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerate coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4).

 **In this proposal, we aim to further develop and expand the capabilities of MesoReefDAO through the Climate Solutions category of the Gitcoin Grants program.**
 
 
 
 Our proposed project includes:
 
 
 
 1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.
 
 
 
 2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.
 
 
 
 3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.
 
 
 
 4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will be used to automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.

 ‚ôªÔ∏è Litter Token pays people to pick up litter. We have already picked up 76K pieces of litter as a community and we have open sourced picture proof for every single piece
 
 
 
 üíö Our community members pick up litter across 10 countries including Brazil, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Colombia , USA, Dominican Republic, South Africa, Philippines, and Puerto Rico
 
 
 
 *USE OF GITCOIN FUNDS*
 
 
 
 üåç We use Gitcoin Quadratic funding to fund more litter pickups across the world!
 
 
 
 üåä Previous Gitcoin funds for example have funded litter pickups in Puerto Rico, Philippines & Nigeria
 
 
 
 üåä For this round, you will be helping fund litter pickups in the Amazon Rainforest, the Pacific Coast of Colombia, and the Boyaca region of Colombia
 
 
 
 *HOW IT WORKS*
 
 
 
 üì∏ Send us a picture of the litter item you picked up and threw out. Post it in our Discord. We then send Litter Tokens directly to your crypto wallet that can be swapped for USDC (1 LTK = $1.28)
 
 
 
 *LESSONS LEARNED*
 
 
 
 üí° Over the past few months, we've discovered new ways to fund our project. The primary sources being grants (like Gitcoin) and creating a partner network of sustainable businesses that agree to give a percentage of their profits to fund Litter Token litter pickups

 The S.A.N.E. Foundation is a pioneering force in environmental stewardship, leveraging the transformative power of web3 technology to address global climate challenges. Our vision is the SANEconomy, a revolutionary economic system designed to align with Earth's biocapacity, providing real-time feedback loops from the biosphere and empowering communities to shape their sustainable futures.
 
 
 
 # Impact & Initiatives:
 
 
 
 ### Bioregional Stewardship: 
 
 
 
 Inland Temperate Rainforest in BC:
 
 We cooperatively steward over 35,000 acres in the Inland Temperate Rainforest of western Canada. We also manage a 400-acre farm and an 80-acre mountain-top ecovillage. Our initiatives here encompass agroforestry, eco-forestry, reintroduction of fire in historically fire-maintained ecosystems, fish rehabilitation, watershed restoration, and wildfire mitigation. We are establishing an 11-acre Resiliency Center to serve as a dynamic hub for community activities, civic engagement, and ecological education. Through these efforts, we aim to foster resilience, robustness, and community well-being, ensuring that the local populace plays an active role in shaping their region's flourishing future.
 
 
 
 Amazon Rainforest Partnership:
 
 In collaboration with the Shuar Nation, we are developing a regenerative economy within the Amazon, spanning over two million acres. This initiative is a harmonious blend of ecological preservation, human wellness enhancement, and the acknowledgment of the Shuar People's inherent sovereignty. As we embark on this transformative journey, we're not only safeguarding an essential ecosystem, but also championing a model where nature, culture, and economy converge synergistically. We have our inaugural series of proposals poised for implementation, and initial investments will be directly allocated to these groundbreaking projects. These encompass the construction of a Shaur Temple of Wisdom, the development of a marketplace, and offices for the Shuar to share their unique goods and services, as well as pivotal forestry restoration projects aimed at enhancing biodiversity and strengthening carbon sequestration. Through these endeavors, we are actively setting the stage for a future rooted in vitality, resilience, and shared prosperity.
 
 
 
 Ecuadorian Andes Engagement:
 
 Our engagement in the Ecuadorian Andes spans over 100 acres, with a focus on ecovillage development, full-stack permaculture, and youth empowerment. Our Ecuadorian Resiliency Center supports civic engagement by bridging local wisdom with innovative sustainable practices. Our Applied Regenerative Sciences Initiative serves as a living testament to holistic regeneration, blending the ancient with the avant-garde. As we cultivate spaces like our research lab amidst flourishing permaculture gardens, we are sowing seeds for a future where science, spirituality, and sustainability converge.
 
 As we continue our work, each bioregion we engage with becomes a model for regenerative solutions, demonstrating the transformative power of community-driven environmental stewardship. As we witness these amazing results, we are gearing up to expand to other territories primed and ready for a sane approach.
 
 
 
 ### NUNA Algorithm: 
 
 The SANE Algorithm, known as NUNA, is central to our transformative approach. While still in development, its foundation is a dual-faceted engine designed to give a voice to nature and human wellness, while also assigning tangible value to natural capital assets and services.
 
 
 
 Voice of Nature and Human Wellness: NUNA, when fully realized, will be data-driven, open-sourced, and constantly evolving. It aims to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data, offering a comprehensive feedback mechanism. Drawing from decades of data collection from our bioregion in British Columbia, which has already been utilized in highly effective fire prediction models guiding strategy and preservation, NUNA's potential is immense. Unlike traditional economic systems that often neglect foundational assets like Ecosystems Health and Services, NUNA's design incorporates these alongside a Human Wellness Index. This promises an economy that values both tangible assets, such as the oxygen produced by an old-growth tree and intangible joys, like the happiness of children playing in a park.
 
 
 
 Assigning Monetary Value: The envisioned brilliance of NUNA lies in its potential to assign value to current conditions and then project values to future desired states. This differential between the present and the future is set to form the core of the SANEconomy. By reverse-engineering these proposed future conditions back to current states, we will assess the impact of our improvements, establishing a unique sector of proficiency within the SANEconomy framework. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Our commitment to NUNA is steadfast, and the funds raised through this grant will significantly aid in its development and realization.
 
 
 
 Proposals & Smart Contracts: Central to the SANEconomy is the concept of Proposals. These are envisioned future conditions that, with NUNA's assistance, are assigned a value. Proposals range from restoring degraded lands to rejuvenating public parks. Once a proposal is approved, a Smart Contract is generated, and SANE tokens, representing the value of the proposal, are minted. This approach ensures that the SANEconomy is rooted in real, tangible actions on the ground, driving regenerative activities.
 
 
 
 From Bioregional to Global: NUNA is designed to function initially at the bioregional scale, with processes replicable worldwide. Over time, its application can expand to national and global scales. By focusing on actionable projects and real activities, the SANEconomy offers a sustainable alternative to traditional economic systems based on debt and infinite growth.
 
 
 
 Technical Backbone: NUNA is built using the Unreal Engine with ArcGIS plug-ins, ensuring robustness and scalability. It is open-source, inviting collective evolution and refinement. As a representation of our collective journey, NUNA aims to align choice-making, economic activities, and the human-nature interface towards a Sustainable, All-considerate, Numinous, and Evolutionary (S.A.N.E.) future.
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Decentralized Finance: 
 
 
 
 The SANEconomy, powered by the $SANE token, is our blueprint for intertwining decentralized finance with ecological regeneration:
 
 
 
 1. Shared Success: Every $SANE holder is not just an investor but also a stakeholder in our regenerative journey. As we achieve milestones in bioregional projects, holders are rewarded, making them direct beneficiaries of on-ground progress.
 
 
 
 2. Stake for the Future: Beyond traditional staking, we offer a chance to invest in the very fabric of our planet. By staking in specific bioregions, you're not just securing a financial future, but also championing a vision of a world that is Sustainable, All-considerate, Numinous, and Evolutionary (aka SANE).
 
 
 
 3. Natural Capital Assets: As the SANEconomy matures, bioregions will launch their own tokens, each backed by their invaluable natural assets. This decentralizes financial power, directly linking the creation of value to the health and vitality of the planet.
 
 
 
 By reimagining the economic reward system, we ensure that value is intrinsically tied to tangible, beneficial conditions on the ground. This approach not only decentralizes economic power, but also empowers communities to drive initiatives that resonate with their bioregional ethos.
 
 
 
 
 
 # Global Network for Regeneration: 
 
 
 
 A New Dawn in Finance: At the heart of the SANEconomy is a commitment to reshape the very essence of finance. We are not just creating a token; we are crafting a new narrative whereby every transaction echoes with purpose, and every stakeholder becomes a guardian of our planet.
 
 
 
 Bioregional Empowerment: Our approach begins locally, but thinks globally. By empowering individual bioregions, we are weaving a tapestry of interconnected hubs, each a beacon of sustainable practices and regenerative actions. This isn't just decentralization; it is a global symphony of ecological harmony.
 
 
 
 Harnessing the Sustainable Impact Market: The world is hungry for genuine, impactful change. The SANEconomy is poised to channel this demand, transforming latent capital into a force for global regeneration. Every stake in our system is an investment, as well as a commitment to a world where sustainability and shared prosperity thrive.
 
 
 
 Beyond Traditional Staking - A Pledge for Tomorrow: With our ""Stake for the Future"" initiative, we are inviting you to be more than just an investor. You become a visionary, pledging allegiance to a world where finance and ecology are inseparable allies.
 
 
 
 Join the Evolution: As we lay the groundwork for this transformative economy, we invite you to be part of this journey. This is more than just a financial venture; it is a call to arms, a movement, a collective dream of a world where every transaction nurtures our planet.

0x61bf50e57da40be19a8964d5064388b9eb0d5f978c6db88e293a7c7041f46998,Digital Gaia: An Open Source Ecosystem to Defeat Moloch and Regenerate the Planet,"**Humanity needs our help!**
 
 
 
 Benefitted by three centuries of relentless technological progress primarily geared towards human advancement, humanity now wields capabilities that might seem godlike‚Äîpossessing the potential to shape the very world we rely upon for our sustenance. 
 
 
 
 Unfortunately, progress in cultivating the wisdom, awareness, and moral guidance necessary to wield technology's power has failed to keep pace. 
 
 
 
 As long as we have more power than collective intelligence to direct technology‚Äôs impact, technology can become a decentralized weapon, causing harm at any scale.
 
 
 
 This is the ‚ÄúMeta-Crisis‚Äù facing humanity, and there is no better example of how the Meta-Crisis manifests itself than Climate change.
 
 
 
 The $105 trillion/year global economy is lurching toward a regenerative future, but it's moving in fits and starts with limited tangible progress. Moloch is at the heart of the problem.
 
 
 
 Moloch ‚Äì a system of bad incentives, negative sum games, unhealthy competition, and misaligned incentives ‚Äì results in a widespread lack of trust and limits coordination within the system. It blocks alignment on effective transition strategies and perpetuates a continuous race to the bottom, serving to exacerbate growing human and environmental crises around the globe.
 
 
 
 **The Opportunity**
 
 
 
 Given the stakes, encompassing the global economy and the prosperity of billions, the opportunity before us is monumental. Digital Gaia's mission is to offer a transformative solutuon to this challenge. As pioneers in developing open AI infrastructure and tools, we enable the seamless integration of Planetary Intelligence into global decision-making.
 
 
 
 **Our mission opens doors for sharing insights and knowledge, grounding decisions in the realms of profit, planet, and people‚Äîultimately steering us toward an adaptive and sustainable future for all.**
 
 
 
 Our open platform and toolkit are designed to aid pioneering leaders in responsible and sustainable enterprises, enabling them to formulate, manage, and oversee the critical decisions that steer transition strategies.
 
 
 
 **Our Project:**
 
 
 
 Our project for the AR18 Climate Solutions grant round is a natural extension of all previous Digital Gaia Gitcoin proposals, the last of which was a Beta round project focused on launching a science-based Co-Pilot to defeat moloch and regenerate the Planet.
 
 
 
 Building on the core tech stack developed and proven with the help of previous rounds, we wi launch an Open Source Ecosystem comprised of science and technology organizations, joining forces to advance a shared protocol and infrastructure for decentralized modeling, planning, decision-making, and automation at planetary scale.
 
 
 
 Our vision is that humanity will use this infrastructure as a civilization-wide shared neocortex and Planetary Intelligence, enabling it to overcome the existential risks of the 21st century, from climate to AI alignment, and transition into a planet-positive species.

 Simbiotica is a web3 analytics provider for scoring and tracking digital assets that have revenue models intrinsically linked to positive impact on people, communities, and the environment.
 
 
 
 Current Progress:
 
 üìä +470 Web3 Impact Institutions Mapped
 
 üíµ+230 Tokens and #NFTs
 
 üìà +$20 Billion USD in Impact Digital Asset market capitalization tracked in real-time.
 
 
 
 Finding the right metrics to assess Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) & Socially Responsible Investing in Digital Assets is difficult. 
 
 
 
 We make it easy with the world‚Äôs first impact assessment framework designed for digital assets.
 
 A market worth over $20B right now is constrained by a lack of data in the value chain. Digital Assets promoting positive impact need to broaden their reach. They need ratings to establish trust, transparency, accountability, and integrity; to increase support for impact and validate this market.
 
 
 
 ‚ÄòSustainability‚Äô as a concept in impact investing is still finding its own harmony with corporate reporting and disclosure practices. Our framework and platform implementation serves to compliment this system by making digital assets the ideal asset class for measurable impact as well as auditable disclosure of relevant and material data, using Web3 and distributed ledger technologies for provenance of purported impact.
 
 
 
 Simbiotica‚Äôs impact assessment framework has streamlined analyzing impact investing industry sectors and topical areas that evaluate tokens across any chain or consensus mechanism on what is relevant and material with regard to digital assets specifically.
 
 
 
 The pillars of our framework are:
 
 Impact üïäÔ∏è
 
 Governance ‚öñÔ∏è
 
 Cyber-security üîê
 
 
 
 The sectors digital assets are categorized in are:
 
 üß™ Health & DeSci 
 
 üíªTechnology
 
 ‚ôªÔ∏èCircularity
 
 ‚ö°Energy
 
 üí∏Finance
 
 üå±Nature
 
 ü´ÇSocial
 
 üßØCarbon
 
 
 
 Our aggregator platform serves as the insight infrastructure for the Regenerative Finance ecosystem and allows investors the real-time tools to accelerate investment in projects and assets whose intentions are to address climate change, advance clean technology, improve economic equity, and support societal welfare. We provide the necessary assessment parameters for developing and implementing a variety of investment strategies for impact digital assets. These parameters make our ratings not only meaningful for investors, but also effective for reputation building by organizations aiming to accelerate their digital asset adoption.
 
 
 
 All Simbiotica‚Äôs headline impact scores and summaries are made public on the platform website, and it is in the best interest of organizations looking to scale adoption to steer their actions toward more positive impact via transparent and traceable measures outlined in our framework.
 
 
 
 Support from this grant round would go directly to continuing our R&D process to ensure our ratings provide the most harmonious, efficacious, and meaningful assessment of the hundreds of digital assets on our platform, and continue to streamline the on-ramping process to bring more digital assets under our review, as well as provide vetted non-Web3 organizations the means to build and deploy digital assets to bring financial inclusion to underrepresented communities. We graciously appreciate your support.

 ---
 
 
 
 ## ü§î The Problem
 
 Heating spaces is the [biggest household energy expense](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php) and accounts for [40% of global energy-related CO2 emissions](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201116-climate-change-how-to-cut-the-carbon-emissions-from-heating). In the EU, almost [63%](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Energy_consumption_in_households) of total household energy is used for heating, while in the US, it's about [43%](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php).
 
 
 
 In addition, data centers and crypto miners already consume [2% of the world's electricity](https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks). [40% of it is used for cooling](https://energyinnovation.org/2020/03/17/how-much-energy-do-data-centers-really-use/), which is enough energy to heat millions of homes or offices.
 
 
 
 ## üí° Our Solution
 
 Furoa is a symbiosis of two products: a *supercomputer disguised as a heating system* and a *decentralized cloud compute platform*. It's built for high-performance compute tasks like AI training/inference, rendering CGI, performing simulations, processing audio/video data, or running crypto staking nodes.
 
 
 
 Unlike existing cloud compute services, Furoa wastes no energy on cooling and doesn't require building huge data centers or hiring thousands of maintenance workers. That makes it a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution.
 
 
 
 ![](https://furoa.co/g/GGBR_01.png)
 
 
 
 ## üîÆ Our Vision
 
 Our vision is for millions of spaces worldwide to be heated using Furoa. With every additional space the combined processing power and degree of redundancy will increase‚Äîbut most importantly, the cheaper access to high-performance computing will become.
 
 
 
 ## üëæ Open Source
 
 We deeply believe that a global computing platform should be built by its community. That's why Furoa's operating system will be open-source once the software and hardware has been battle-tested.
 
 
 
 ## üí∏ Use of Funds
 
 All funds we receive will go towards prototype development.

 [GoodDollar] (http://www.gooddollar.org) is a universal basic income protocol with a vision any person to access a digital, sustainable universal basic income. 
 
 
 
 For Gitcoin Round 18 (Climate Solutions), we are raising funds to support GoodCollective, a platform that supports climate impact initiatives through enabling direct digital payments to individuals who perform verified climate stewardship.
 
 
 
 Environmental stewardship of local communities in key conservation areas will create a significant impact in preventing the depletion of natural resources. [GoodDollar](https://gooddollar.org/) has partnered with [Appropriate Design](https://twitter.com/appropriatedsgn?s=20), [dOrg](https://www.dorg.tech/) and the [Climate Collective](https://twitter.com/clim8collective?s=20) to build GoodCollective, a dapp that support sustainable environmental practices at the local level, with a focus on direct payments to the individuals doing the work. The GoodCollective platform and its 2 pilot deployments provide direct payments to those verifiably safeguarding and preserving their local habitat. The mission of GoodCollective deeply aligns with GoodDollar‚Äôs mission to deliver digital money to those who need it most and Climate Collective‚Äôs objective to utilize trusted, sustainable digital infrastructure to unlock verifiable climate action at scale.
 
 
 
 This blog post shares more information on GoodCollective, and a demo video: 
 
 https://medium.com/gooddollar/announcing-goodcollective-a-platform-to-provide-direct-payments-for-climate-impact-initiatives-753fcad85b0a
 
 
 
 // Why Support GoodCollective? 
 
 
 
 GoodCollective is currently live and being used to support two first of its kind pilots which link automated digital payments to verified stewardship efforts. The first two live deployments (currently in action) are DeTrash in Brazil to support recycling, and Silvi in Kenya which supports reforestation.
 
 
 
 We defined [criteria](https://www.notion.so/011e418e5af54a9ebc98586971f6ad6a?pvs=21) to ensure our pilot partners have the mission alignment, community reach, and operational setup required for success. We chose to work with [DeTrash](https://site.detrash.io/)/[Neduc](https://twitter.com/neduc_social?s=20) and [Silvi](https://twitter.com/SilviProtocol?s=20) as our first partners to pilot GoodCollective as a complement to their respective stewardship and climate impact programs. Each partner has a track record in pioneering environmental impact initiatives, and our pilot design aims to amplify their efforts through incentivization via G$ payments.
 
 
 
 Based on extensive research into the socioeconomic factors of each region and the need for geographical variety, implementation of targeted UBI payment distribution follows pilots in Coroadinho, a neighborhood in S√£o Lu√≠s, Brazil, and the Kakamega forest in Western Kenya.
 
 
 
 In select areas of Brazil, Peru, and Israel, [DeTrash](https://twitter.com/DetrashGlobal?s=20) is a technology platform that compensates community members and recycling facilities for recycling, upcycling, and composting. Neduc, a women-owned and operated social enterprise, is a local partner to DeTrash, and diverts plastic from landfills by turning it into practical goods.
 
 
 
 Silvi operates in the US and Kenya to reforest high-impact areas with native trees. We have partnered with them on their work in the Kakamega forest in Western Kenya, which focuses on stewardship of native tree genealogy, reforestation, and biodiversity preservation. Silvi enlists local community members ‚Äî typically farmers living near target areas ‚Äî to participate in restoration activities and measure their progress. Both pilot partners have a deep and direct relationship with the communities they serve and are committed to accurately measuring climate impact.
 
 
 
 // How Will the GR 18 Funds Be Used? 
 
 
 
 - Fund Conservation Basic Income and G$ payouts for two existing pilots and existing 40+ stewards currently performing climate action in Brazil and Kenya
 
 - Fund the conservation basic income and program management costs of upcoming deployments and partners

 R3WILD is creating the first global community-owned wildlife reserve, enabling anyone, anywhere to become a custodian of wilderness areas and assets.
 
 
 
 We are a passionate team of conservationists with a focus on restoring and rewilding degraded land, connecting it to existing wildlife ecosystems to preserve and expand the habitats of endangered species, reduce CO2 and uplift impoverished local communities through eco-tourism.
 
 
 
 R3WILD is the web3 initiative to accelerate our on-the-ground rewilding and conservation efforts. We aim to democratize access to wilderness assets through fractional ownership, so that anyone, no matter their location, can become a custodian of a block of land in Africa. Blocks from 1 sqm to several acres will be available on our marketplace as NFTs, linked to the physical block of protected R3WILD land. Landholders will be granted access to the R3WILD ecosystem, where they can be involved in real-time wild experiences, real-life events, and rewards with our brand partners. 
 
 
 
 Through our network and current partnerships, we have access to approximately 15 million acres of land across various African countries that are in need of protection.
 
 **We‚Äôre on a mission to revolutionize the conservation landscape and empower planet-conscious individuals to actively participate in the causes they support.**
 
 Donations raised from GG18 will be put towards building and launching our land marketplace. We would love to have you as part of our journey!

 This climate-solutions project is based on cutting edge biotechnology, taking digital NFTs and converting them into a biological format to create NFPs: a new format for data storage that is literally carbon absorbing.
 
 
 
 The goal of this grant is to raise funds to support the technical costs of developing this experimental project at the intersection of DeSci and ReFi. 
 
 
 
 The long-term vision is to create a public good for regenerative data storage.
 
 
 
 ## What are NFPs?
 
 NFPs are real plants which store NFTs in their DNA. To do this we use DNA data storage technology to provide a clean and natural way to store digital files in harmony with nature.
 
 
 
 Today, we‚Äôre demonstrating the amazing potential of this tech through an experimental project storing NFTs in the first generation of NFPs.
 
 
 
 ![Presenting NFP to Vitalik Buterin at Funding the Commons, Paris 2023](https://growyourown.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/funding_commons_v1.jpg)
 
 
 
 ## Why store data in this way?
 
 DNA is the most dense format for data storage yet discovered - petabytes of data could be stored in a single gram of DNA without emitting any CO2. Any type of digital data can be stored in DNA in a format that never goes obsolete and can survive millions of years.
 
 
 
 Since DNA is compatible with organisms like plants and trees, this means we could even grow organisms that can store data and remediate carbon.
 
 
 
 Today we can only store a very small amount of data in this format, which makes NFTs a great candidate for early experimentation.
 
 
 
 ## But how do you store data in a plant?
 
 We start with a digital file (like a JPEG) and convert the digital data (0s and 1s) into the language of DNA (A, T, C, G). Next we use proprietary processes to safely transfer digital files into plant genomes.
 
 
 
 It works! We can store any type of digital file in plants. We've even figured out how to retrieve the data.
 
 
 
 ![Converting a digital file from binary into DNA (ATCG)](https://growyourown.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GYOC_Binary_to_DNA_opt.gif)
 
 
 
 You can learn more about how this works on the Netflix show '[The Future of](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21138236/)' where our work is featured.
 
 
 
 ## What kinds of data will you store in an NFP?
 
 We're starting out with NFTs, creating an organic and carbon negative backup of the artwork and data that would normally exist on-chain and in the cloud.
 
 
 
 For the first generation we will be creating a collective piece involving the wallet addresses of all contributors to the project to form an artwork that will be stored in the first-ever NFP.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Is there any risk to the NFT / NFT Owner?
 
 We are creating a 'biological backup' of an NFT. This does not involve accessing private keys to NFTs or present any risk to NFT owners.
 
 
 
 Our goal is to work with creators and developers who would like to collaborate on a novel artistic and technical experiments with our concept.
 
 
 
 If you are a creator or developer and would like to collaborate please reach out to [cyrus@growyourown.cloud](mailto:cyrus@growyourown.cloud)
 
 
 
 ## Is this safe for the plant?
 
 Yes! The data is stored in a way that doesn't affect the plant or its interactions with other organisms.
 
 
 
 The data stored in an NFP is a tiny fraction of the overall size of the plant's genome. All this means NFPs grow, live and reproduce as normal.
 
 
 
 ## Who's behind this?
 
 NFPs are developed by [Grow Your Own Cloud](https://growyourown.cloud): an award-winning research organization dedicated to developing a truly green future for data.
 
 
 
 We combine art with science, and believe that working with nature as a technology is vital to help regenerate the environment. Our work has been featured in Wired, Netflix and awarded science breakthrough of the year 2022 by Falling Walls.
 
 
 
 ![Winners of Art-Science Breakthrough of the Year 2022](https://growyourown.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/221109_XFW_PHT151.jpg)
 
 
 
 ## What will the funds be used for?
 
 1. Technical processes: Conversion of digital data to DNA, DNA Synthesis.
 
 
 
 2. Synthetic biology: Creation of plant vectors, growth of generations of NFPs.
 
 
 
 3. Development costs: Website dev, Smart contract dev, audits.
 
 
 
 4. Exhibition and presentation: The display of NFPs to showcase and educate the public on this futuristic climate solution.
 
 
 
 ## What does this lead to?
 
 NFPs are our way of bringing a vision for a truly regenerative internet to life. Through initiatives like NFPs, we are growing a link between the worlds of Web3 and WebTreeüå≥. 
 
 
 
 You can support this vision by supporting our Gitcoin grant to help us develop this experimental project grow into a regenerative public good:
 
 
 
 *Today - NFPs*: using DNA data storage technology to cleanly archive single files
 
 
 
 *Tomorrow - Digital Gardens:* storing GBs of data as part of a clean data ecosystem
 
 
 
 *Future - Data Forests:* storing TBs and Petabytes of data while capturing tonnes of CO2

0x1ee3f4586e37274f4d4ffdf49d0862b835adeb7488935ef3681deef3b4b848cd,Afrocarb,"Afrocarb is a simple digital platform that enables African green initiatives/companies to trade their impact with non-green entities and sustainability angels, to scale their project and impact - helping non-green businesses to achieve their sustainability targets through verified emission offsets & impact credits. 
 
 
 
 This innovative blockchain marketplace serves as a bridge, fostering both environmental progress, environmental impact and investment transparency, for social and economic growth in Africa.
 
 
 
 # Why this Project?
 
 a). 7 of the 10 climate-impact most vulnerable nations are African nations.
 
 b). 9 of 10 impacts and emissions-related green companies we have engaged in Nigeria want to participate in the Emissions Trading market but lack easy access to do so.
 
 c). Local impact green projects and businesses across Africa are encouraged verbally but investment and trade trust remain distant.
 
 
 
 Africa cannot continue to rely solely on external aid for enduring climate resilience. This underscores the timeliness and appeal of the Afrocarb marketplace solution.
 
 
 
 a). Empowering Local Green Initiatives: Afrocarb's primary focus is to uplift African green projects by easing their access to the global impact and emissions market. It's dedicated to boosting local sustainability efforts, which will lead to positive environmental and socio-economic changes across the continent and beyond..
 
 
 
 b). Seamless Emission Offsets: Afrocarb offers non-green companies an easy and effective way to transparently offset their greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in emission reduction projects or purchasing verified GHG emission credits through Afrocarb, these businesses get to take traceable tangible steps towards sustainability without disrupting their core operations as they move toward 100% eco-friendliness.
 
 
 
 c). Transparent Marketplace: Afrocarb's transparency with blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and exchanges are clear, accountable, and transparent to all. This level of openness builds trust around the African impact and emissions trading markets, making us a reliable platform for both green projects and businesses looking to make a positive impact.
 
 
 
 d). Driving Holistic Change: By connecting green projects and non-green companies, like Amazon connected buyers with sellers, Afrocarb contributes to a comprehensive approach to environmental progress. This interconnectedness promotes a balanced ecosystem where everyone plays a part in building a more sustainable future, even while transitioning.
 
 
 
 e). Sustainable Growth: With Afrocarb, green projects can scale their operations and have a greater impact on their communities and the environment. Likewise, non-green businesses can evolve towards more sustainable practices, ensuring a greener, healthier future for all.

 # What Impact Will This Project Make?
 
 Afrocarb is best described as a twofold impact project:
 
 
 
 a). Green Projects Growth: Afrocarb facilitates the growth of both existing and new African green initiatives by providing them with easier access to the global impact trading market. This means more renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and conservation projects can be realized, leading to reduced carbon emissions, improved resource management, and enhanced environmental health.
 
 
 
 b). Sustainability for Non-Green Companies: Non-green businesses will be able to easily and transparently contribute to sustainability efforts by trading cash for quality emission offsets through Afrocarb. This will help them align with environmental goals, decrease their carbon footprint, and actively participate in the fight against climate change.

 In summary, with this twofold impact, Afrocarb directly improves the lives and livelihoods of the average African and the overall life expectancy as environmental and social conditions are improved.
 
 
 
 # How will funds be used?
 
 If awarded the grant, we would allocate the funds to maximize our growth and impact on frontline communities and further enhance the implementation of our solution. Here is a sample budget outlining how we would utilize the GitCoin Grant:
 
 
 
 a). Community and Stakeholders Engagement ):
 
 Organizing community events, and focus groups to involve frontline community members in decision-making processes
 
 Developing culturally sensitive and accessible learning materials (like ‚Üí https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QYbiQVqfj6aMheUPMF4dw7jIAQhlM4ot/view?usp=sharing) and campaigns to raise awareness and encourage eco-friendly transitions
 
 Speed up our partnership with academia for exponential adoption and direct industry and social advancement.
 
 
 
 b). Afrocarb Beta Catalysis :
 
 Conducting first-scale verification and validation of at least 15 green projects in Nigeria for impact and emissions offset credit listing.
 
 Although we will continue building regardless, the grant will help speed up the development and improvement of our ecosystem technology, data management systems, and monitoring tools to enhance the efficiency and scalability of our solution and cascade impact on more green projects.
 
 
 
 c). Legislature and Registrations :
 
 With our legal team member, we will secure necessary permits/certificates/licenses/goodwill with different relevant agencies.
 
 
 
 By allocating our prize money strategically across these key areas, we will foster community engagement, empower frontline communities, implement impactful projects, enhance our technological capabilities, and provide direct support to those most in need. 
 
 
 
 # Afrocarb success/impact measurement
 
 We measure the impact of Afrocarb through:
 
 a). Counting the number of green projects receiving support for impact expansion.
 
 b). Calculating emissions cut from funded projects and offset investments.
 
 c). Monitoring businesses buying offsets to encourage sustainability.
 
 d). Gathering stories of local benefits, like clean energy supply and jobs from projects.
 
 e). Collecting feedback from satisfied project owners and companies.
 
 
 
 Afrocarb perfectly fits the Gitcoin 18 Climate Solutions Round as our live demo which is just about 4 months old proves that blockchain technology, NFTs, and Crypto can be brilliantly used to advance climate action through the simultaneous growth of green projects and reduction of GHGs across African communities for global impact. After opening up our application for GHG reduction projects across Africa, starting with Nigeria, we have so far received the interest of 3 projects as we expect to get more in the coming weeks with more awareness.

 We have four core elements of the protocol which address different problems in the current waste management space:
 
 ‚Äî The marketplace (connecting everyone in the value chain while providing data and value)
 
 ‚ÄîThe Token (the currency for the circular waste economy)
 
 ‚ÄîThe DAO (a coalition of recyclers, decision-makers, NGOs etc to support funding for waste recovery projects, research and scaling of existing technologies)
 
 ‚ÄîThe Oracle (a human-powered data aggregator and validator providing accurate waste data for insight and action)
 
 
 
 Traction
 
 - We hosted the first community Hangout in Lagos (https://tribuneonlineng.com/at-wasset-community-hangout-experts-harp-on-effective-waste-management-practices/)
 
 - We've developed the wasset Merchant app 
 
 - We partnered with over 4 recycling companies
 
 - We partnered with over 3 NGOs
 
 - We developed the payment processing and protection DApp to power the marketplace (Using mobile number and USSD code)

 # Climate Impact
 
 
 
 BETTER is building an endowment for planet positive impact via the BETTER CLIMATE FUND, which is governed by the community through a DAO. Our growing list of Climate Advisors helping to steward the best possible use cases for the Fund include policy and strategists from Climate Resolve, Toucan and MIT. ü§ù 
 
 
 
 The future of the BETTER CLIMATE FUND is in the hands of the community, meaning it could expand into any number of different areas including conservation, new forms of tokenized climate impact credits, individual donations to compelling causes, and more. üåø

 The Elephant Room is a decentralized campaign organization that creates multimedia campaigns to move the needle on climate change. Working with Indigenous organizations, Web3 entities, voting organizations, neighbourhoods, cities and activists to promote climate action to communities around the world and to counter the vast array of fossil fuel advertising and disinformation.
 
 
 
 **GR18 Update**
 
 
 
 Since the last round we have begun the process of creating foundational crypto materials to familiarize businesses, governments, climate organizations, activists and media with how blockchain can be useful for climate solutions.
 
 
 
 We have received two grants from the Ethereum Foundation to enable our work. This has given us the opportunity to work with some exciting blockchain enabled climate solutions projects and help tell their stories. Our goal is to create replicable and scalable templates for decision makers and other businesses.
 
 
 
 ![Elephant in the Room Banner](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/5a16d4dadb11cccae6c62de2367edbb4/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_10.37.50_PM.png)
 
 
 
 Strategic messaging about the climate crisis needs to be around every corner including the corners of Web3 and yet, it is mostly absent. Even with a worsening situation every day, extreme weather events and storms becoming the norm, yet still well under 1 percent of overall news coverage was devoted to climate change last year and a majority of people still report that they rarely talk about climate change with their friends and family. 
 
 
 
 ![A billboard that says Vote for Salmon not a pipeline](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/5527fd004620fc6be0c3fc4aa83f229b/Screen_Shot_2019-07-09_at_11.39.07_PM.png)
 
 
 
 While the majority of people understand that climate change is real, there is still no feeling of urgency and rarely are people aware of the solutions available to us‚Ä¶our mission is to change that. making the solutions real and tangible for people. 
 
 
 
 We need a major shift in our approach to communications around the climate crisis. In order to do that we connect the dots for people on the things that motivate them to act; finding the inroads in specific communities around urgency, step-by-step solutions, and alternatives.
 
 
 
 We ‚Äúfill the gaps‚Äù by organizing and implementing the type of strategic campaigns that no one else is doing. Working both independently as well as with other nonprofits, First Nations/Native Americans, governments of all sizes and other partners to spread awareness, motivate change, find common ground and make solutions a reality.
 
 
 
 ![A picture from the Great Climate Race](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/c50ce756c387b5243741d47ede07cb53/Screenshot_2019-05-09_at_11.26.23_PM.png)
 
 
 
 Our campaigns are local, involve existing networks and grassroots organizations and both air and ground games. We utilize digital platforms as well as traditional and in person methods to create a sense of community involvement as well as political mandate. We also work to incorporate important messaging into existing media (TV, Film, radio, podcasts etc.)
 
 
 
 ![A meme showing two futures one bleak and one hopeful](https://c.gitcoin.co/docs/2cc732f64f0ed2ef04f9959ec782c092/FEQAXFNXIAIgC1t.png)
 
 
 
 We have worked on hundreds of campaigns over the past 25 years ranging from stopping destructive mega projects at the community level to actively participating in and speaking at world summits; always with the goal of changing the conversation especially with those not already in the conversation.

 **What problem do we address?** 
 
 
 
 We address the ""elephant in the room"". Looking for ways to communicate and dialog with people about climate solutions that are usually left out of the conversation. We work with indigenous groups, immigrants, farmers and those about to be sunset out of energy jobs. We work with diversity, equity and inclusion groups as well as social and climate justice organizations. We are constantly testing what works and what doesn‚Äôt work; where the polarity lies and how to stop the divisiveness that has infiltrated every conversation.
 
 
 
 
 
 **How we address it?**
 
 
 
 Our goal through each of our campaigns is to turn apathy, fear, and discord into action, cooperation and ultimately, heroism. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A few examples of our work includes;
 
 
 
 
 
 **The Great Climate Race**

 March 15, 2019 - PRESENT
 
 
 
 **Historical Background**
 
 
 
 The Fridays For Future movement, school striking for Climate Justice, has been a cornerstone in mainstreaming Science through internationalist pressure. After more than four years, it is now evident that a lot more work needs to be carried out, especially involving the Global South, where some children don‚Äôt have the ability to go to school, let alone strike from it.
 
 
 
 Historically, it is true that barely anyone knows about us, but our contributions and willingness to keep attempting to change the status quo should be remembered in the books. We not only foresaw the revolution of October 17, 2019, but had organized a dozen marches prior to this week which witnessed the largest wildfires we have ever seen, demanding PM Saad Hariri to declare a State of Climate Emergency. We also took part in the revolutionary protests, setting up community kitchens on food waste; clothes, books and electronics exchange; as well as a series of webinars you may find on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvHOd4IEZJbnlBWQd8XyHxA) with ex-combattants, artists and many more‚Ä¶. .
 
 
 
 With an ever repressed youth movement in the Arab region this decade, we find ourselves held at gun-point to keep shut. Effectively, the Fridays For Future international movement contact in Lebanon found themselves having to protest and organize with the families of those suffering because of the political negligence which blew up our capital on August 4, 2020, as Justice was delayed for more than the five days promised, until today: they, who had launched Lebanon‚Äôs Blue/Green New Deal, were shot 18 shrapnels pointed at the chest and face, as Emanuel Macron celebrated France‚Äôs return to Great Lebanon, with TotalEnergies inviting the two arch-enemies of Israel and Hezbollah into bed over fossil gas profits, and planning for the Port.
 
 ---
 
 Oil-rich Arab investments to rebuild post-war Lebanon were all for nothing, except the benefit of those who pillaged our archeological heritage! We are not asking them for favors, it‚Äôs their moral duty to finance us, properly this time, to start protecting our forests, rivers, endemic biodiversity and peoples.
 
 ---
 
 
 
 **GR18 Against Police-States and the IMF / World Bank**
 
 
 
 Today, unity was struck between Lebanon‚Äôs secular civil society, the families of the 235 victims killed, the thousands of injured and hundreds of thousands of those who lost their homes to the Beirut Port Blast, together with the feminist movement behind the longest sit-in in global politics demanding a recognition of victimhood due to war to the women whose husbands and children were disappeared during the 15 year Civil War; abruptly ending, recycling warlords to parliament.
 
 
 
 Last week, in commemorating three years since the Port Blast, Fridays For Future Lebanon not only picked back up its radical hope to stop the delay of Justice by organizing at the side of a relatively new Secular students‚Äô union ‚Äì taking the frontlines, and single-handedly blocking the highway road which still constitutes an unresolved crime scene ‚Äì but we also had a presence at the side of the families of the firefighters sent to turn off one of the largest non-nuclear bombs, reassuring them that we stand with them until the very end: until Climate Justice is served!
 
 
 
 Certainly, we are better positioned to promote climate solutions than the IMF/World Bank with its disastrously corrupt dams, here.

 - Creating new public spaces where local communities can safely flourish in solidarity, against a backdrop of ‚Äòsextarian‚Äô discourse blame shifting against LGBTQAI people, greatly at risk.
 
 
 
 - Liaising with other youth groups, revolutionary political movements, grassroots technologists, and the religious establishment for a September of global actions to End Fossil Fuels for Climate Education & becoming the first Arab country to adopt the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty.
 
 
 
 - Campaign for demilitarization with Arab peers, and put an end to creative emissions' accounting and fake solutions -- echoing Palestinians' call to Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israeli settler colonialism.
 
 
 
 - Show our peers at FFF MAPA and International what is possible when we organize using the best tools for bringing direct democracy.

0xf84965b2f70bbe2b142eafb0fdefb3a0120c0a5e9c2ca02c61622162c246636a,Biolumen,"The Biolumen Project is a reforestation initiative focused on offsetting the ecological footprint generated by specific actions or individuals by planting trees in the Eje Cafetero, one of the most biodiverse regions per square meter in the world. The goal is to support biodiversity conservation, restore degraded ecosystems, and capture carbon dioxide to mitigate climate change.
 
 
 
 Project focuses:
 
 
 
 Contribute to offsetting the ecological footprint of individuals, companies, or organizations by planting trees in the Eje Cafetero region.
 
 Promote the conservation and enrichment of local biodiversity, including the protection of endemic and endangered species.
 
 Restore degraded areas caused by deforestation, agricultural expansion, and other human activities, improving soil and water quality.
 
 Strengthen the carbon storage capacity of ecosystems in the region, contributing to the fight against climate change.
 
 Promote environmental education and awareness of the importance of reforestation and biodiversity conservation in the region.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The primary objective of the project is to offset the ecological footprint of individuals, companies, or organizations by planting trees in the Eje Cafetero region. By doing so, Biolumen hopes to promote the conservation and enrichment of local biodiversity, including the protection of endemic and endangered species. The project also aims to restore degraded areas caused by deforestation, agricultural expansion, and other human activities, improving soil and water quality in the process.
 
 
 
 In addition to offsetting the ecological footprint, Biolumen aims to strengthen the carbon storage capacity of ecosystems in the region, contributing to the fight against climate change. The project hopes to promote environmental education and awareness of the importance of reforestation and biodiversity conservation in the region.
 
 
 
 Biolumen has three main focuses for its Beta Round of Gitcoin. The first focus is to use a percentage of the funding to compensate for at least 1% of the total participants in the current round. If the current round has the same number of participants as the past Alpha round, which had over 26,000 participants, then more than 436 tons of CO2 would be generated just by breathing. This serves as a reminder to reflect on our ecological footprint and take action to reduce our emissions through various activities. Part of the funding will be calculated and compensated through tree planting, as well as the development of content to promote mitigation exercises of our footprint.
 
 
 
 The second focus is to develop a pool tree, which involves creating a seedbed of endemic species of the region to ensure reforestation with a positive ecosystem impact. Biolumen plans to use part of the funds raised for this seedbed, which will be available for planting through donations in the future.
 
 
 
 The third focus is on education. The Biolumen team is dedicated to conducting web3 onboarding talks through participation in decentralized communities such as Ethereum Colombia. The project aims to combine efforts to continue educating in development and web3 education, but also to provide education on ReFi, explaining ways to build sustainably using this technology.
 
 
 
 Overall, the Biolumen Project is a crucial initiative that aims to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote sustainable development in the Eje Cafetero region. Through reforestation, the project hopes to offset the ecological footprint of individuals and organizations while also promoting environmental education and the conservation of biodiversity."

 ## Introduction ##
 
 Pollen Buzz Initiative is a project that envisions a world where beekeeping education fosters environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and sustainable livelihoods. Operating primarily in the states of Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, we aim to create a thriving regional community committed to nurturing the environment and uplifting society through beekeeping initiatives. Our comprehensive services include beekeeping training, expert consultations, bee health assessments, practical workshops, hive setup assistance, and guidance in honey harvesting to name a few. Through these initiatives, we empower individuals to become skilled beekeepers, promoting the well-being of bees and their environment while generating sustainable income.

 ## What We Have Done So Far: ##
 
 In the past two years since its inception, Pollen Buzz Initiative has made significant strides towards its mission of promoting beekeeping education and sustainability in South India. We successfully conducted pilot beekeeping training programs in select communities, training a total of 250 individuals in various aspects of beekeeping.
 
 
 
 ### Case Story 1: Venugopal from Chitavalli Village, Chikkamanglore ###
 
 
 
 [![Screenshot-2023-08-11-at-4-40-27-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/44215fWS/Screenshot-2023-08-11-at-4-40-27-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/K4LLc2SP)
 
 
 
 Venugopal, a farmer from Chitavalli village faced challenges in his Areca nut garden, experiencing significant flower and nut drop, resulting in lower profits, unable to pay back government loans. When invited by us for a free Beekeeping Training Program, he immediately seized the opportunity. After two days of theoretical and three days of practical training, he learned about rearing bees, hive management, honey production, and more.
 
 
 
 With one set of apparatus provided by us (bee box, stand, and bee colony), Venugopal set up a bee box in his Areca garden. After 4 to 5 months, he started harvesting honey as a byproduct. Notably, he observed a gradual decrease in flower and nut drop compared to the previous year. Encouraged by this success, he obtained additional bee boxes from friends at the Horticulture Department and the Forest Department, now manages eight boxes in his garden. He produces 8 to 10 kg of honey per box annually.
 
 
 
 Income from Honey: Rs. 16,000 per year (20 kg at ‚Çπ800 per kg)
 
 Areca Yield: Increased by 30 quintals after keeping bee boxes, benefiting both Venugopal and as well as his neighbouring farmers.
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Case Story 2: Brahmaiah from Dasarahalli Village ###
 
 
 
 [![Screenshot-2023-08-11-at-4-40-48-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Dwxs25RY/Screenshot-2023-08-11-at-4-40-48-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/SnzjdLSW)
 
 
 
 Brahmaiah, a young farmer from Dasarahalli village, aspired to enhance onion seed production through beekeeping. He joined Pollen Buzz Initiative's Training Program, gaining insights into the role of bees in pollination. Initially, he harvested 235 kg of onion seeds, selling 102 kg for ‚Çπ1,42,800 with a net profit of ‚Çπ67,800.
 
 
 
 After maintaining two bee colonies, his onion seed production improved significantly. He harvested 205 kg of bold onion seeds, sold 102 kg for ‚Çπ1,78,500, and used the rest for the next season. Brahmaiah's additional income from beekeeping amounted to ‚Çπ35,700, as he avoided pesticide use and adopted organic plant protection methods.

 Here's a more concise version of the given content:
 
 
 
 # üåü Kula's Approach: Stewardship & Global Knowledge Weaving üåê
 
 Kula's core revolves around Stewardship and Global Knowledge Weaving, blending local action with global connections to amplify our mission's impact.
 
 
 
 Stewardship:
 
 - Local Action & Connection
 
 Each Kula project is led by a local steward who:
 
 - Manages daily operations aligning with our governance approach.
 
 - Connects with community members and stakeholders, representing Kula.
 
 - Allocates grassroots resources and manages risks.
 
 
 
 ## Global Knowledge Weaving: Spreading Insights Worldwide
 
 Our stewards not only act locally but contribute globally by:
 
 
 
 -Sharing insights and best practices.
 
 -Promoting cross-pollination of ideas.
 
 -Collaborating on a global scale and assessing the impact of initiatives.
 
 -Through these efforts, Kula fosters global regenerative change, interconnectedness, and resilience.
 
 
 
 # üåø Sacred Sanctuaries: Harmony with Nature üåè
 
 Regenerative Villages for Holistic Living
 
 Kula aims to:
 
 
 
 - Cultivate community learning.
 
 - Establish regenerative and compassionate living rooted in nature.
 
 - Integrate permaculture principles into sustainable models.
 
 - Sacred Sanctuaries (SS) go beyond conservation, integrating both tangible and spiritual elements for regenerative development.
 
 
 
 The Essence of Sacred Sanctuaries
 
 Beyond being geographic spaces, Sacred Sanctuaries are entities of spiritual and ecological value, steeped in history and traditions. Kula focuses on reclaiming their significance while fostering human-nature symbiosis.
 
 
 
 Beyond Conservation: Holistic Design
 
 We champion regenerative stewardship over mere conservation, pulling inspiration from indigenous wisdom. Key design pathways include:
 
 **Design Pathways**
 
 
 
 - **[Interpretive Centre](https://www.notion.so/Sanctuary-Handbook-86815d251c3b45778245bc2acdea06bb?pvs=21)**
 
 - **[Food production system](https://www.notion.so/Sanctuary-Handbook-86815d251c3b45778245bc2acdea06bb?pvs=21)**
 
 - **[Nursery and Experiment Lab](https://www.notion.so/Sanctuary-Handbook-86815d251c3b45778245bc2acdea06bb?pvs=21)**
 
 - **[Integrated Animal Husbandry](https://www.notion.so/Sanctuary-Handbook-86815d251c3b45778245bc2acdea06bb?pvs=21)**
 
 - **[Earthen Architecture](https://www.notion.so/Sanctuary-Handbook-86815d251c3b45778245bc2acdea06bb?pvs=21)**
 
 
 
 The placement of each design pathway into the landscape is extremely important and needs to be analyzed as the goal is for waste is to be minimized. A closed-loop recycling environment that weaves the different pathways together can help to ensure the inputs and outputs of each pathway are connected with the inputs and outputs of other pathways in a mutually beneficial fashion.
 
 
 
 ### Building Meaningful Relationships: Community Engagement
 
 
 
 Central to the success of the Sacred Sanctuaries is our strong focus on community engagement. We understand that these sanctuaries are not just ecological assets, but also socio-cultural landscapes that shape community identities, livelihoods, and ways of life.
 
 
 
 We work closely with local communities, recognizing them as equal partners in the stewardship of their sacred spaces. We encourage their active involvement in decision-making processes, integrating their traditional knowledge, values, and practices into our initiatives. This inclusivity fosters a sense of shared ownership and responsibility, strengthening community resilience and commitment to sanctuary protection.
 
 
 
 ### **Weaving Global Knowledge: Learning and Collaboration**
 
 
 
 Sacred Sanctuaries is also a platform for global knowledge weaving. We create channels for knowledge exchange between different sanctuaries, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and experiences. Through this global network, successful local strategies can be shared, adapted, and implemented in other contexts, promoting learning and collaboration across geographical boundaries.
 
 
 
 By embracing Sacred Sanctuaries, we at Kula hope to contribute to a future where human societies live in harmony with nature, where the sacredness of our environment is revered, and where every community is empowered to steward their own sacred sanctuaries, ultimately leading us to a more sustainable, equitable, and regenerative world.
 
 
 
 ### Stewarding Narratives: Regenerative Content and Education
 
 
 
 The power of narrative is not just an anecdotal force but a potent binder that draws communities together, coalescing diverse stakeholders around a united vision for transformative change. By wielding narratives as a core tool, we dive into bioregional sub-narratives such as ""Rethinking Urban Livelihoods,"" ""Regenerating the Indo-Gangetic Plain,"" and ""Conserving the Biodiversity of the Western Ghats."" Each of these tales is not just a standalone story; they intricately interweave within the grander tapestry of regeneration and belonging crafting a narrative quilt that both enlightens and educates.
 
 
 
 Central to this effort is the Unorthodox Publishing Co., a beacon within Kula's initiatives. Unorthodox doesn't merely narrate; it delves, exploring depths of local issues, challenging mainstream perceptions, and spotlighting stories that often lurk in the shadows. Through its unique approach, it brings to the fore narratives that provoke thought and challenge the status quo, nurturing a sense of belonging while pushing boundaries.
 
 
 
 As these myriad narratives‚Äîboth mainstream and Unorthodox‚Äîcome together, they blur the lines between individual endeavors. In this melting pot of stories, we see the emergence of a dynamic, interconnected network of efforts that transcend the sum of their parts. This synergy amplifies each sub-narrative's resonance, catalyzing not just understanding, but sparking action, empowerment, and a collective drive towards a brighter, regenerative future.
 
 
 
 By embracing Sacred Sanctuaries, we at Kula contribute to a future where human societies live in harmony with nature, where the sacredness of our environment is revered, and where every community is empowered to steward their own sacred sanctuaries, ultimately leading us to a more sustainable, equitable, and regenerative world.
 
  
 
 
 
 ## üöÄ Our Initiatives Focused on Climate Solutions üåø
 
 
 
 ### Unorthodox Publishing Co. üìá
 
 
 
 Unorthodox Publishing Co., a cornerstone initiative of Kula, harnesses the transformative power of art and storytelling to cultivate community belonging. But Unorthodox isn't just about tales‚Äîit's about truth and action. It amplifies marginalized voices, particularly those bearing the brunt of climate change and environmental injustices. Going beyond surface-level narratives, Unorthodox dives deep, unearthing stories that challenge the status quo, shedding light on the intertwined paths of environmental regeneration and social justice.
 
 
 
 By valuing diverse narratives, not only fosters a vibrant civic space where communities feel empowered to share but also paves the way for informed civic engagement, bridging the gap between awareness and actionable change. When these tales are woven and resonated across communities, they spark collective learning, instigating crucial dialogues on localized solutions and regenerative practices. In essence, Unorthodox isn't just a publisher‚Äîit's a catalyst, driving both understanding and unity in the face of global challenges.

 ### Kumta Sacred Sanctuary üçÉ
 
 
 
 Nestled within Karnataka's lush landscape, the Kumta Sanctuary stands as a beacon of Kula's commitment to holistic environmental stewardship. This sanctuary as part of the bioregional narrative of ""Conserving the Biodiversity of the Western Ghats"" represents more than just a conservation project; it's a multifaceted climate solution. By closely collaborating with local communities and land stewards, we've developed a sanctuary that champions biodiversity, regeneration, and climate resilience.
 
 
 
 Here, native species find refuge, ensuring ecosystem balance and resilience to climate disturbances. Through afforestation and regenerative agricultural practices, the sanctuary functions as a natural carbon sink and bolsters soil health. Furthermore, by integrating indigenous knowledge with modern conservation techniques, we're not only preserving the environment but also cultivating regenerative livelihood opportunities. With each step, Kumta embodies the fusion of ecological conservation with community empowerment, leading the way for regenerative climate solutions in the heart of India.

 ### Bangalore Sacred Sanctuary üåø
 
 
 
 Situated within the vibrant heart of one of India's bustling metropolises, the Bangalore Sanctuary stands as a testament to rethinking urban livelihoods in the face of rapid urbanization and environmental degradation. This sanctuary is not just about ecological restoration; it's a radical reenvisioning of how urban spaces can harmonize with nature. Partnering with local communities, the sanctuary emerges as an oasis amidst concrete jungles, bringing together vibrant green spaces, community engagement, and ecological education.
 
 
 
 Beyond merely adding greenery, the sanctuary serves as a functional climate solution. It plays a pivotal role in carbon sequestration, moderating urban heat islands, and innovatively managing water resources. Moreover, it serves as a tangible bridge, reconnecting urban dwellers to nature's rhythms and emphasizing the critical roles of biodiversity, regenerative livelihoods, and conservation in modern city life. This initiative is not just about rewilding a fragment of the urban space; it's a bold reimagining of city life, threading it with regenerative practices, traditional wisdom, and a profound respect for our environment. Through such projects, we are challenging and reshaping the narrative of urban development, advocating for cities that don't just grow, but thrive in harmony with nature.

 ### Shimla Sacred Sanctuary üèî
 
 
 
 Situated in the majestic landscapes of Himachal Pradesh, the Shimla Sacred Sanctuary is more than just a conservation effort; it stands as a beacon of climate resilience and regenerative living. This sanctuary seeks to renew the profound connection between the local communities and their natural surroundings, championing an approach that merges time-tested wisdom with modern environmental imperatives. Our emphasis on restoring traditional architecture symbolizes a dual commitment: preserving a rich cultural heritage and leveraging designs that naturally combat climate challenges, all while employing locally sourced materials that reduce carbon footprints.
 
 
 
 Central to the sanctuary's vision is its intricate water management system. Drawing inspiration from the Himalayan contours and the winding courses of its rivers, we've adopted measures that not only conserve water but also recharge groundwater levels, thus securing a sustainable water source for the community. This emphasis on water also speaks to the sanctuary's broader ""source to sink"" philosophy, a comprehensive approach to water management that fosters sustainable utilization while minimizing wastage.
 
 
 
 Beyond physical structures, Shimla Sanctuary serves as an educational hub. By immersing locals and visitors in a space where they can witness the seamless amalgamation of heritage and regeneration, we are cultivating a community that is acutely aware of climate issues and motivated to be part of the solution. Moreover, while the sanctuary's biodiversity conservation initiatives remain implicit, their role in fostering resilient ecosystems cannot be overstated. Together, these efforts mark the Shimla Sanctuary as a foundational step in our broader mission across the Indo-Gangetic Plain, aiming to craft settlements that are both water-resilient and environmentally harmonious.

 # Introduction
 
 
 
 In Croatia, Italy and Kenya Marko Serena and Simon are implementing Solar Energy and sustainable water management at different scales.
 
 
 
 In the Italian Alps and Apennines more than 20 hectares of forest are being protected and augmented, while the same is happening in Nyandarua and Golas with local trees and natural guilds.
 
 
 
 In Chile, under the Hornopiren volcano, Lissette is cleaning the forest from abandoned trash and repurposing the materials into compelling sculptures.
 
 
 
 In Germany and Brazil Lenara is growing low-maintenance urban carbon sinks, biodiversity havens inside the city.
 
 
 
 *Our aim as growers, farmers and artists is to share knowledge and resources, while augmenting the land we can steward, restore and protect from intensive agriculture, exploitation and pollution.*

 # Gitcoin Grant Round 18 Update
 
 
 
 
 
 **What I was able to achieve/build/buy thanks to your support:**
 
 
 
 I was able to introduce 3k catfish in my 300 sq. meters pond (surface area). Previously the pond was just empty and served as a water pan. I was also able to introduce water plants. 
 
 On another small 30sqm surface area pond, I introduced tilapia: bought pipes and fittings, an aerator and a pump to keep the water as fresh as possible. Also started experimenting with a small aquaponic system.
 
 During a previous drought most of my young trees couldn‚Äôt make it. With the help of Gitcoin grant I was able to replace my small bamboos, 470 eucalyptus, bought 200 cypresses and 300 prunus africana; an indigenous species very useful especially for medicinal purposes. 
 
 
 
 **How is my project evolving, the future I could grow:**
 
 
 
 Having a bee colony in one of the three beehives on land, most of the fruits and crops in our garden is pollinated 50% by that colony. My garden is a 4 portion ¬º acre with sunflowers and squash on one portion, brassicas on the other, legumes on the third portion and nightshades on the last one. The intention is to maintain a consistent annual crop rotation routine so no crop of the same family will grow in one portion for four years. I want to have more colonies, more beehives as the future of our world's food security depends on our little yellow striped friends.
 
 Bearing that in mind, we do our best to protect them by never using chemicals to spray the fruits or the crops as pesticides. Pretty much everything is organic. In the future, we want to introduce useful plants along the fences as both a food hedge (fedge) and a natural pest-control hedge.

 # Gitcoin Grant Round 18 Update
 
 
 
 
 
 **What I was able to achieve/build/buy thanks to your support:**
 
 
 
 Establish the pilot Solar-powered watering station, buy/produce seeds and winter nutriment for wildlife in 4 feeding stations for 24 months, grow 130 new oaklings from genetically diverse seed, clean up two hectares of polluted forest in both Apennine and Alps, harvest from the pilot oyster mushrooms indoor cultivation + container harvest of potatoes and onions, grow the wild and heirloom seed bank, transform a neglected space into a micro synergic garden for biodiversity, advocating and convincing a neighboring olive trees orchard owner to transition to no-till/grassing, stopping this way the great soil erosion and biodiversity loss on half the hilltop. 
 
 
 
 **How is my project evolving, the future I could grow:**
 
 
 
 I‚Äôm researching and designing a new plot in the Alps, where ancient terraces once hosted community-grew food forests. The vegetation testifies a very close relationship between the locals and the woods, as villagers are still able to recall intercrops under the chestnut/walnut/hazelnut canopies. Furthering the exploration, I‚Äôll gather soil samples and prepare to produce and apply natural soil conditioners where needed. These restored territories could offer several crops, some from the local tradition and some new: buckwheat, potatoes, cabbage, blueberry and wild strawberry will have endemic shrubs and herbs as growing companions, such as heather, pellitory, nettle and mugwort. Beside restoring and enhancing the historical value of these ancient food forests, a very interesting system we could favour and then observe in this plot is the mycorrhizal symbiosis in Ericaceous, here as endemic blueberries and heathers. 
 
 
 
 At regr√≤ in Maremma, Tuscany, the main goal for the near future is to secure the 23 hectares of recovering forest from hunters, gatherers and polluters. The most endangered area has been subjected to cuttings in its perimeter to allow access to game: a general population decline in boar, roe deer, mourning dove and corvids is visible after the hunting season, while a recent decree, designed to curb the wildlife‚Äôs assaults to civilization, has declared ‚Äòhunting ground‚Äô even highly protected areas in the country. Many of the species we try to protect in Maremma are currently listed as at high risk of extinction. Your contribution will help build, grow and maintain borders to keep exploiters outside the forest while preserving and restoring wildlife corridors.
 
 
 
 **The regr√≤ animal sanctuary**
 
 
 
 A recent change in legislation will allow us to open a sanctuary for animals rescued from the food chain and other exploitative systems. We are in the process of researching the necessary documentation and educating ourselves about the needs these survivors will have, and how to ensure them a safe place to thrive. The structures we will build for the animals will reuse materials we found on site from the previous owners, and locally sourced natural materials.

 Summer 2023: Arrange and buy things for watering, installed one water collector from the roof of tools container, get various water plants, arrange a garden for eatables, plant various plants and flowers, get e trimmer and chainsaw branches cutter.
 
 
 
 **How is my project evolving, the future I could grow:**
 
 
 
 For 2023/2024: Planting more trees and making the garden part bigger and fencing it, fight the invasive blackberries and get some barn manure. Get more water plants and make more floating islands. Mulch a part I can‚Äôt cut by hand, build few more compost sites, get more local wild smaller plants to grow there, build constructions for climbing plants, create more micro stone-zones for agaves, succulents and similar. Install two water containers near the garden and install the watering tubes through the garden. Build and repair some drywalls. Start making sculptures using cut branches, old clothes and cement, paint the tools container.

0x27dfbe7a9c237ab618003d6406d8144dcd6916ebe55265a9b3ef5490db971ca8,DeFood: Decentralized Food Security Network (DFSN),"DeFood is short for the Decentralized Food Security Network (DFSN), which explores ways to decentralize food security both in the physical realm, by expanding localized food production, processing and distribution, and also in the virtual realm, using Blockchain technology as the basis for revenue streams to monetize carbon sequestering assets and support localized trade and digital currencies.
 
 
 
 Stage 1 goal is to use Salt Spring Island, BC (in Canada), as a model for DeFood. On the physical side, DFSN will pursue decentralization projects like 50 Farms, which addresses multiple problems at once: creates a geographically distributed network of 50 farms doing CSA programs for healthy food supply and community engagement, improves long-term emergency preparedness, and provides both new farmer support and mentoring as well as monetary support of mid-size farms that are struggling. 
 
 
 
 On the virtual side, we'll be building capacity for additional revenue streams to food producers through securitizing natural assets on the model of -- and in collaboration with -- organizations like Centree and Kolektivo. While this model has often been applied just to forests, we seek to expand it to regenerative agriculture, wild-harvesting and marine-based food production (including kelp farming), all of which can sequester more carbon than steady-state forests. In the long run we want to use this to support a localized digital currency that will keep value circulating in the community, and free up food producers from the debt cycle that is driving many of them out of business."

 # üåé The Problem -
 
 
 
 a) Agriculture, forestry, land use, and livestock sectors contribute to around 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With a growing population and increasing demand for food, agricultural activities are expected to rise, potentially worsening the situation through increased use of chemical fertilizers.
 
 
 
 b) In India, the farm sector accounts for 19.6% of GHGE, preceded by the energy sector (44%) and the combined manufacturing and construction sector (18%).
 
 
 
 c) Major components of GHGE from the Indian farm sector include:
 
 
 
 üêÑ Livestock Sector (54.6%): Methane emissions from enteric fermentation of feed, and nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized feed production. India has the world's largest cattle population, accounting for 78% of 24 million methane emissions, 80 times more potent than CO2.
 
 üåæ Nitrogenous Fertilization (19%): Nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils, 300 times more potent than CO2.
 
 üåæ Rice Cultivation (18.5%): GHGE from inadequate rainfall conditions.
 
 üî• Other Emission Sources (7%): Livestock management (6.9%) and stubble burning (2.1%).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 # üí° Our Reduction Strategies -
 
 Significant scope exists for reducing GHGE in India's farm sector, which accounts for ~23% of the country's power consumption. Key strategies include:
 
 
 
 **üåæ Introduction of Regenerative Agriculture to the Local Ecosystem.**
 
 
 
 **‚òÄÔ∏è Enhancing the use of non-conventional power sources, such as solar energy.**
 
 
 
 **üíß Reducing the elevation head for irrigation pumps by employing groundwater recharging techniques like reviving local water bodies and rainwater harvesting in human settlements.**
 
 
 
 **üå≥ Efforts to revive the forest cover and perennial rivers to not only reduce GHGE but also enhance biodiversity.**
 
 
 
 By implementing these strategies, we can make a positive impact on the environment and help India achieve a more sustainable future for its agriculture sector.
 
 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 # **üåø Project Description -**
 
 
 
 The project idea stems from the premises mentioned earlier, focusing on a multi-pronged approach to address the various causes of GHGE. Each part of the approach will be executed simultaneously with the others. Below is a brief description of each part, its objectives, and the problem it aims to address.
 
 
 
 
 
 # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Part 1 - Introduction of Regenerative Agriculture to the Local Ecosystem üåæ
 
 
 
 **Key aspects:**
 
 
 
 * No plowing or turning of soil
 
 * Earth cultivates itself naturally
 
 * No tilling required; seeds are encased in clay pellets
 
 * Reduced weeds and pests through crop rotation
 
 * Soil becomes richer and more productive with each cycle
 
 
 
 To begin with, we aim to dedicate 5 acres of our own arable land to adopt the ""NO TRACTORS, NO PESTICIDES & NO TILLING"" farming technique. This low-investment approach was first developed by Masanobu Fukuoka in his village on Japan's Shikoku Island, and is elaborated upon in his book, ""The One-Straw Revolution."" The method has proven successful without sacrificing economic aspects, such as crop yield and quality. It entails sowing clay-encased seeds of rice or other suitable seasonal crops, covering them with straw, watering the field, and letting it dry naturally. The straw is then lightly threshed for stability, and regular irrigation is maintained. In due course, the barley crop matures and is harvested and threshed, providing barley straw for cover. Periodically, a thin layer of chicken and green manure is spread to decompose the straw, followed by sowing clover seeds as ground cover three weeks before paddy harvest.
 
 
 
 Although natural cultivation shows great promise, it is vastly different from conventional farming methods. As such, it is crucial to prove its effectiveness, showcase its results to encourage broader adoption, and secure the necessary resources before the idea gains traction and contributes to environmental enhancement. The promotion of this method will demand considerable patience and financial commitment.
 
 
 
 
 
 # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Part 2 - Revival of Local Water Bodies and Use of Solar Power in Irrigation üåä‚òÄÔ∏è
 
 
 
 **Key aspects:**
 
 
 
 * Revive encroached water bodies, recharging aquifers and reducing power consumption
 
 * Install solar-powered irrigation pumps to reduce dependence on conventional power
 
 * Promote Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) for a financially viable transition to solar power
 
 
 
 Our second initiative will focus on reclaiming encroached water bodies. While this endeavor requires the cooperation of local civic and legal authorities, we have been liaising with local government bodies for several months, and the Central Government's Amrit Sarovar Project shares the same objective. This effort will significantly recharge aquifers, decrease elevation heads for irrigation pumps, and reduce power consumption.
 
 
 
 In parallel, we plan to install solar-powered irrigation pumps to lessen farming's reliance on conventional energy sources. The large-scale adoption of solar power might not yield immediate quantifiable results, but it will eventually lead to a decreased demand for grid power in agriculture. Despite government subsidies, solar power equipment installation remains capital-intensive. To make the transition financially feasible, the switch must be distributed among numerous users. The government promotes Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), which consolidate small landholdings on a cooperative basis to make per capita capital costs and other overheads more sustainable. However, the threshold for such aggregation is relatively high.
 
 
 
 We propose attempting aggregation at a lower but optimal level and scaling up once the endeavor proves successful. Surpassing the threshold for FPOs offers numerous financial and collateral advantages.
 
 
 
 # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Part 3 - Revival of Local Forest Cover üå≥
 
 
 
 **Key aspects:**
 
 
 
 * Reclaim encroached forest land
 
 * Implement extensive plantation of minimal-irrigation plants along roads and vacant government land
 
 * Collaborate with a local Agriculture College to identify soil-specific, low-water-requirement plants
 
 
 
 The restoration of water bodies relies on sufficient rainfall. About two decades ago, the area boasted a dense forest cover and numerous orchards. However, due to the authorities' neglect in preserving these green covers, there has been a steady decline in their presence. While the Forest Land still exists in Revenue Records, it is crucial to reclaim it from unauthorized encroachments. Although it may not be feasible to restore the orchards since locals have repurposed them as farmlands, planting low-irrigation plants along roads and vacant government land offers the path of least resistance for enhancing the green cover.
 
 
 
 We plan to carry out this project in partnership with a local agriculture college affiliated with a leading Agricultural University in Bihar. The college authorities have already pledged their support in identifying both farm and non-farm plants that are suitable for the specific soil, require low water, and minimally impact the ecosystem.
 
 
 
 # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Part 4 - Rejuvenation of Kao (Kav) and Thora Rivers üèûÔ∏è
 
 
 
 **Key aspects:**
 
 
 
 * Rejuvenate the river systems, contributing to groundwater recharging and providing arsenic-free potable water
 
 * Revive ancient forest cover, attracting higher precipitation
 
 * Overcome challenges like encroachment identification, clearing, and desiltation/dredging through government programs and local government coordination
 
 
 
 **Useful Links:**

 https://www.livehindustan.com/bihar/buxar/story-garbage-dumping-yard-has-become-the-bank-of-kava-river-in-dumraon-3457926.html
 
 
 
 As our most ambitious part of the project idea, this initiative has the potential to drastically enhance groundwater recharge in the neighboring agricultural belt and ensure arsenic-free drinking water for a significant portion of at least three districts in Bihar: Rohtas, Bhojpur, and Buxar.
 
 
 
 The project focuses on the rejuvenation of the Kao and Thora rivers. The Kao river originates from a 130-foot high perennial waterfall called DHUAN, named after the smokescreen-like appearance created by water droplets bouncing up to 60 feet. The waterfall sources its water from the Kaimoor Plateau, making the Kao river perennial as well. The river meanders through rocky obstructions before reaching the plain after a journey of less than a kilometer. Approximately 30 km downstream, it converges with the Thora river. Initially sourced from an artisan well, the Thora river faced blockage due to human interference. However, the source resurfaced downstream, and the river continues to flow, providing pollutant-free water from its subsurface stream.
 
 
 
 Kao and Thora rivers merge and proceed toward the Ganga (Ganges) river. After about 60 km of combined flow, they fall into Kokila Taal and ultimately meet the Ganga through Kokila Taal. These rivers were vibrant water systems until encroachment and siltation began to clog them a couple of decades ago, resulting in their current impending extinction.
 
 
 
 Reviving these river systems will contribute to the restoration of an ancient, large forest cover, attracting above-average precipitation in the area. Rejuvenation efforts face numerous challenges, such as identifying encroachments through drone mapping, clearing encroachments (including riverbeds), and securing manpower through government programs like MNREGA for desilting and dredging the riverbeds. This process will necessitate close coordination with local government officials, potentially involving the judicial system. Consequently, this uphill journey will require substantial financial support and seamless collaboration.
 
 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 # **üéØ Project's Target Population and Geographical Area -**
 
 
 
 The project will have a direct impact on the ~150,000 inhabitants of the Buxar district in Bihar, India. üáÆüá≥üë©‚Äçüåæüë®‚Äçüåæ
 
 
 
 We also intend to create a replicable model which can be open-sourced so that it can be used by any farmer across India.
 
 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 # **üìÜ Proposed Project Timeline, Total Budget and Breakdown of Expenses üí∞ -**
 
 
 
 It has already been mentioned that the various parts of the project ideas can be implemented simultaneously, though the time frame for reaching each part to a level of self-sustenance may differ for each. The seeds of the project ideas were sown about a year ago. This involved traveling, informal meetings, and data collection. Though no formal record has been maintained, the preparation has involved an expenditure of about $6,000 out of personal resources.
 
 
 
 The projection of the time frame and financial outlay is discussed part-wise below:
 
 
 
 # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Part 1 - ‚ÄúIntroduction of Regenerative agriculture to the local ecosystem‚Äù üåæ
 
 As previously mentioned, the innovative agricultural approach will complete its first cycle within a year, allowing the demonstration of success in at least two seasonal crops for further expansion by ourselves and others. Throughout this period, public relations efforts will be maintained by organizing site visits and hosting audiovisual seminars.
 
 
 
 Time frame: 1 year
 
 Cumulative expenditure: $25,000
 
 
 
 The true challenge lies in promoting the concept and consolidating fragmented land holdings into functional units via cooperative structures. Addressing numerous legal issues and establishing the credibility and sincerity of our intentions through prolonged and in-depth engagement with potential collaborators will require both time and significant financial investment.
 
 
 
 Time frame: 3 years
 
 Cumulative expenditure: $40,000
 
 
 
 # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Part 2 - ‚ÄúRevival of the local water bodies and use of Solar Power in irrigation‚Äù üíß‚òÄÔ∏è
 
 
 
 The results of efforts in this phase will become evident within two years, assuming normal rainfall. This process will also require labor costs for excavating blocked water bodies to sufficient depths, creating rainwater channels and embankments, installing deep tube wells, and acquiring solar pumps and panels. While substantial government support is anticipated, it is wise to establish a reserve fund to guarantee smooth and uninterrupted execution.
 
 
 
 Time frame: 2 years
 
 Capital expenditure: $60,000
 
 
 
 # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Part 3 - ‚ÄúRevival of local Forest cover‚Äù üå≥
 
 
 
 Reviving the green cover is a lengthy process that will necessitate significant involvement in legal proceedings. While the government and local Agriculture College may assist with tree planting, our organization will need to handle the judicial aspects. Given the extensive encroachment on land that was once forested, it could take approximately five years to restore the area to its original state.
 
 
 
 Time frame: 5 years
 
 Pre-operative and capital expenditure: $60,000
 
 
 
 # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Part 4 - ‚ÄúRejuvenation of Kao (Kav) and Thora rivers‚Äù üåä
 
 
 
 As previously stated, this is our most ambitious project idea, and understandably, it will have the longest implementation timeframe ‚Äì at least five years. The process requires a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the river basin's degradation extent. Drone technology must be employed to obtain real-time data. Rectifying the situation cannot rely solely on voluntary participation from the people involved, necessitating a challenging and costly legal process. Restoring channels, constructing embankments, and dredging the basin are all demanding and expensive tasks.
 
 
 
 Time frame: At least 5 years
 
 Fund reserve: $200,000
 
 
 
 **To summarize, the overall time frame required for the project is about 5 years, with an aggregate fund requirement of ~$400,000**. Apart from raising grants from Gitcoin and other web3 and web2 organizations, we will also explore funding options like carbon credits forward markets and tap into various government initiatives to support projects like ours. üöÄüí°

 Since 2019, we have built a community of more than 200.000 volunteers, organized 4500+ events, and are active in 96 countries along 161 rivers. As a result, we permanently removed 3.4 million kg of waste from the environment, including 2.000.000+ kilograms of plastics.

 *Vision statement explained*
 
 
 
 When formulating our vision statement in 2021, we extensively discussed our desired vision for the future. What did we want to achieve ultimately? The answer was obvious: plastics have no place in our rivers, so rivers should be 100% free of macro and microplastics.
 
 While that's certainly ambitious, the alternative of not even trying to make rivers plastic-free didn't and still doesn't feel right. The costs for present and future generations of plastic pollution are simply too devastating.
 
 
 
 At one point, going to the moon was also considered impossible, yet people went. Ambition does not blind our sense of realism, though. Making rivers plastic-free is a step-by-step process. It may not be achievable for all rivers in the world, but every piece of plastic we collect is removed forever. So, every km of river cleaned is a step in the right direction. And in the end, we may have to accept that some pollution is too difficult or costly to remove, but at least it's a well-thought-through decision and not merely a lack of effort.
 
 
 
 ## Our solution: The Ripple Model 
 
 
 
 The Ripple Model is an open-source, ready-to-use, hands-on Theory of Change (ToC) by River Cleanup to make rivers plastic-free. How it works and what role we play are outlined in this summary. 
 
 
 
 [![RC-Theory-of-Change-10-Nov-2022-horizontal.png](https://i.postimg.cc/05MCTbN6/RC-Theory-of-Change-10-Nov-2022-horizontal.png)](https://postimg.cc/jCTNNqPK)
 
 
 
 ## Mission 
 
 River Cleanup is a global network organization stopping plastics from reaching our oceans by cleaning rivers, changing behavior, and transforming organizations.
 
 
 
 [![before-after-cleanup.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xdrFcMFb/before-after-cleanup.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/pmZBShv2)
 
 *--Ishem River, Albania--*
 
 
 
 *Mission statement explained*
 
 
 
 River Cleanup aspires to be a global network. The notion of being a network organization is driven by the belief that we need more cooperation. No single entity can solve the problem alone; our strength is connecting people. 'Operational' network emphasizes the fact that we are action-driven and impact-focused. We plan to integrate more web3 tooling as our organization continues evolving in this fast moving space.
 
 
 
 ## Values
 
 1. Professional | 2. Inclusive | 3. Positive | 4. Ethical | 5. Impact-driven
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Priorities 
 
 In addition to prioritizing holistic solutions to make rivers plastic-free, we also defined additional general priorities to direct our precious time and resources:
 
 
 
 ‚óè Top 1000 most polluted rivers 
 
 
 
 In practice, we can and will support efforts to make other rivers plastic-free as well, but this is less of a priority because we have more impact focusing on these 1.000 rivers that account for 80% of the ocean plastic leakage.
 
 
 
 ‚óè Macroplastics 
 
 We focus our limited resources first and foremost on macroplastic pollution because of the following reasons: 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Impact: by reducing macroplastic pollution, we stop new microplastic pollution
 
 ‚Ä¢ Efficiency: a single plastic can disintegrate into 10.000+ microplastics
 
 ‚Ä¢ Experience: we do not yet have extensive experience with microplastics
 
 
 
 ## Workflow
 
 
 
 The following workflow is integrated into the Theory of Change to enhance its practical use even further. 
 
 
 
 **1. Assessment**
 
 Everything starts with a holistic assessment of the pollution problem in and around the river (section). Points of attention include the type of pollution, environmental, socio-economic, and cultural (root) causes, volume, etc., as well as the feasibility of potential solutions in each of the three pillars: clean, educate, and transform. 
 
 
 
 **2. Planning & Funding**
 
 Based on this assessment, an action plan is made. In parallel, funding needs to be secured. 
 
 
 
 **3. Implementation**
 
 Local awareness-raising events and experiences create community buy-in for implementing clean, educate and transform activities. 
 
 
 
 **4. Monitoring & Evaluation**
 
 Careful monitoring and evaluation of pre-established output, outcome, and impact KPIs keep the implementation on track.
 
 
 
 **5. Celebrate**
 
 Every success, big or small, is celebrated. Local action, global impact.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## 5 main pillars of the Ripple Model
 
 
 
 ### 1. Awareness raising
 
 
 
 Generating awareness through a variety of activities and events, both at the local and the global level, is essential for three reasons:
 
 1. Enthusiasm/sense of urgency to act 
 
 2. Solution (provider) awareness (enable people to learn about River Cleanup and partners)
 
 3. A foundation for (local / river-level) system change (community buy-in is crucial for and through the implementation phase. 
 
 Local-level awareness raising is something any organization that likes to work with this Ripple Model can do. In addition, river Cleanup can handle national and global awareness raising.
 
 
 
 Examples of activities used (by River Cleanup) to raise awareness: River Cleanup Day, World Cleanup Day participation, River Cleanup World Challenge, company cleanups and inspiration sessions. 
 
 
 
 #### Impact onboarding
 
 
 
 We are continously looking for incentives to bring mobilize and reward our particpants. Optimism based tools can play a vital role in strenghtening our community and reporting impact on chain

 *Douala, Cameroon*
 
 
 
 ### 2. Assessment
 
 
 
 Effectively and efficiently making a river plastic-free requires a thorough understanding of the local context and root causes of plastic pollution in a river (section). Thorough doesn't mean time-consuming, but it needs to be done well. 
 
 
 
 That is why this Theory of Change and any intervention River Cleanup supports or undertakes within River Cleanup 2.0 starts with a holistic assessment of a river (section) and the surrounding areas that may contribute to or influence plastic leakage into the river. This assessment is the basis for a solid action plan, which is important to secure financing and gain/maintain local stakeholder support. 
 
 ‚ÄÉ
 
 
 
 #### Components of the assessment
 
 The assessment needs to be developed but is ideally a holistic (problem) assessment, looking at the problem and potential solutions from a legal, socio-economic, cultural, security, and environmental perspective. This includes:
 
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Basic information: area, country, population, security situation, languages spoken etc. 
 
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Problem assessment: main types of plastics, volume (legacy/new), sources of mismanaged plastics, pollution hotspots on land and in the river, points of leakage, socio-economic/cultural drivers, the negative consequences for people, animals, and the environment etc.
 
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ River parameters (length, source, rainfall, depth, tides, surface area, flood prove areas, tributaries etc.) 
 
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Current interventions what has been done, when, locations, by whom, outcomes, reasons for success/failure etc.
 
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Stakeholder analyses: who are the key stakeholders (polluters, decision-makers, local solution providers), what is their current role in the local plastics value chain, what is their potential to contribute to solutions etc.
 
 
 
 #### How to use the assessment
 
 The assessment, over time, can become an online do-it-yourself tool for (local) organizations worldwide, integrated into the River Cleanup website, and a paid service by River Cleanup for (local) governments and/or nonprofits who prefer to have the assessment professionally done. Example workflow:

 ### 3. Clean
 
 
 
 Plastic-free rivers can only be achieved by cleaning up plastic historic (legacy) plastic leakage. The preventive collection contributes to avoiding leakage. Once sorted, plastics are ready to go into the circular economy. Emergency interventions (in case of flooding) are high impact, rapid collection of plastics/waste on land and rivers to contain and remove plastic leakage.
 
 
 
 Under clean, we distinguish five types of activities: 
 
 
 
 [![clean-picture.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ZY71c9MC/clean-picture.png)](https://postimg.cc/jCfgqjKb)
 
 
 
 These are the main KPIs to monitor progress and measure the results of clean activities towards the desired overall impact:

 *Albania*
 
 
 
 ### 4. Educate
 
 
 
 The clean pillar takes care of the legacy plastic pollution and creates a temporary plastic-free environment. The educate and transform pillar focus on permanent plastic-free rivers. Primary and secondary schools and universities play an essential role in making and keeping rivers plastic-free in the short, medium, and long term. The education pillar within the Ripple Model fulfills three critical functions:
 
 
 
 1. Gateway to communities 
 
 Schools and universities are often at the heart of local communities. In combination with their role as safe spaces for learning, schools and universities are ideal access points to a community.
 
 
 
 2. Direct impact & maximum lifetime impact (individual student)
 
 Through educational programs, children can immediately contribute to stopping leakage and start substituting, reducing, collecting, and reusing/recycling. Children have a lifetime of potential positive impact on plastic-free rivers ahead of them and are tomorrow's leaders and decision-makers.
 
 
 
 3. Direct impact & community support (community)
 
 A student generally has a network of at least 2 to 5 family and community members that can be reached via the student and school. Educational programs also provide a basis for community buy-in to sustain longer-term support for clean and transform activities.

 *Belgium*
 
 
 
 ### Transform
 
 
 
 People are the solution to plastic pollution in rivers. But for many people, this requires change. Transform translates as 'to change the form of something¬¥, and the positive connotation it usually has is carried forward in this pillar of the Ripple Model. 
 
 The transform pillar consists of two components that both deal with change but in different ways at different stages of the plastic life cycle. Structural change focuses on the part of the life cycle where plastics have not (yet) become waste. The circular economy component focuses on plastic waste once it has been sorted. 
 
 
 
 **Component 1: Structural change** 
 
 
 
 Inspiring & facilitating structural (behavior) change in people and organizations to maximize the substitution and reduction of (single use) plastics
 
 
 
 **Component 2: Circular economy**
 
 1. Collecting, sharing, and facilitating the implementation of existing and innovative circular economy solutions
 
 2. Processing sorted plastics
 
 
 
 *Structural change explained*
 
 
 
 This structural change component of the transform pillar of the Ripple Model focuses on activities to inspire & facilitate structural (behavior) change in people and organizations to maximize the substitution and reduction of (single use) plastics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 *Priorities*
 
 
 
 * For maximum impact, we focus primarily (but not only) on substitution/reduction of consumer single-use plastics (also in line with BtPW), as these are the most significant contributors to plastic river/ocean pollution. 
 
 * The primary target audience is the general public. 
 
 
 
 * Single-use plastics in company production processes are not a primary focus because this kind of substitution/reduction is often highly specific and requires a different approach from company to company. 
 
 
 
 *Circular economy explained*
 
 
 
 In the clean pillar, we focus on collecting and sorting plastics. 
 
 But what to do with these plastics once sorted? 
 
 Everyone working on the problem of plastic pollution faces that same question. Instead of answering this question ourselves, we share the results and insights.
 
  
 
 
 
 1. Maintain/prolong the use
 
 2. Reuse / redistribute
 
 3. Refurbish/remanufacture
 
 4. Mechanical recycling (washing/shredding)
 
 5. Chemical conversion
 
 6. Safe (leakage-free) disposal 
 
 7. Incineration (as a final last resort)
 
 Put differently, solutions to maintain and prolong the use of plastics in their original shape are preferred. If that's not possible, we look at reuse or redistribution options. If that's not possible, refurbishing, and remanufacturing options, etc. By maximizing each preferred solution, we ensure that the maximum percentages of plastics are processed in the best possible manner.
 
 
 
 [![Transform-picture.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8zXhjSKJ/Transform-picture.png)](https://postimg.cc/k28Vpkdq)
 
 
 
 ### General Impact KPIs
 
 
 
 Activities result in outputs, outcomes, and, eventually, these three desired impacts. Each impact KPI is subdivided into three performance levels. The lowest level, level one, corresponds with macro/micro plastic-free rivers (negligible amount). The intervention area can be a part of a river, e.g., 1 km, and does not have to be a whole river at once. Therefore, a river can vary in score depending on the section.
 
 
 
 [![impact-kpi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/WbbFryJM/impact-kpi.png)](https://postimg.cc/bdWwf3gJ)
 
 
 
 ### Contribution to SDGs
 
 
 
 Making rivers plastic-free directly contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Breaking the Plastic Wave has quantified the System Change Scenario's contribution to nine SDGs. In addition, we have added SDG 17 to the Ripple Model because of the crucial role partnerships play in making rivers plastic-free.

 ## TEAM ##
 
 
 
 Atlantis was founded by two mechanical engineers, Irthu and Nakul, decade-long friends who spent the last 5 years building climate solutions.
 
 
 
 Their first venture, Hydrop, was a decentralised water network that served over 11,000 users in Bangalore. Bootstrapped and profitable, this helped them build out their bigger vision in the form of Atlantis.
 
 
 
 Irthu S is a Mechanical Engineer and Product Designer with 10 years XP in Startup Saas and Ecommerce built his first venture in climate tech in 2018.
 
 Nakul R is a Mechanical Engineer, specialised in leading Operations and Finance. Before joining Irthu, Nakul spent over 5 years in the Aeronautical and Healthcare sectors.
 
 
 
 In the last 5 years, both founders have accumulated vast experience building climate solutions on-ground across different terrains and geographies within India. Fast forward to today, there are over 12 core contributors and over 3000 community members across the world helping build Atlantis.

We are growing a movement of regenerators around the world through the most rewarding and transparent tree planting. Jimi Cohen personally set a new World Record for tree planting and the Treegen movement will break the record for most trees planted by any number of people in a 24 hour period, which is 350 million trees, set by Ethiopia.
 
 
 
 ![Jimi Planted 23,810 Mangrove Trees in 24 Hours](https://i.postimg.cc/4ysX3g0x/Tree-Planting-Champion.jpg)
 
 
 
 üå≥ **THE CHALLENGE**üå≥
 
 
 
 **Misaligned Incentives**
 
 Our economy currently values the degeneration of nature more than it values the regeneration of nature. Until it flips the other way, nature will continue to be degraded.
 
 
 
 **Impact Transparency**
 
 The impact sector faces criticism for not providing enough transparency. Donor updates are often reused, leading to lack of trust and reduced contributions overall.
 
 
 
 üå≥ **HOW WE WILL SOLVE IT** üå≥
 
 
 
 **Tokenized Trees**
 
 The $TREES token with Proof of Plant - only issued to those who prove that they have proven they have planted mangrove trees by filming the land before & after for our AI tree counter to assess. Treegen DAO members also validate the videos submitted, GPS coordinates & the Treegen planters to avoid double counting. These tokens are Eco Credits, which follow a set of biodiversity methodologies that not only prove that trees have successfully been planted but are also growing over the course of 3 years. 
 
 
 
 ![Nature Revalue](https://i.postimg.cc/T3zDkQCx/revalue-nature.png)
 
 
 
 **Non-Fungible Updates (NFU)**
 
 Every single tree planted by Treegens or funded for our For Trees Club partners to plant is counted with AI, with more than 97.5% accuracy. Videos with this AI tree counter overlaid are then brought on-chain as Non-Fungible Updates. Livepeer helps us scale this process. 
 
 
 
 ![AI Tree Counting Software](https://i.postimg.cc/nh6P5gDS/AI-Tree-Counter.webp)
 
 
 
 **Dynamic Semi-Soulbound Tokens (DSST)**
 
 Treegen NFTs dynamically display your impact metrics. The mind orbs & heart orbs get brighter according to how many trees you either fund or plant respectively, both verified with AI. While the underlying artwork is transferable, these overlaid orbs are non-transferable and will display on whichever Treegen NFT is connected to our DApp for your profile. This is because we are gamifying regeneration. 
 
 
 
 **Carbon Forwards - Rewarding Exponential Growth**
 
 We will be unlocking the full potential of carbon forwards as a catalyst for exponential regeneration while rewarding Treegens. 
 
 
 
 Carbon forwards are where impact investors buy the future value of carbon credits in the short term. Even though these forwards are sold at a reduced rate, they still equate to approximately 9X more than what it costs to plant the mangrove trees. This is after dedicating 50% for sustainability & conservation efforts and 10% towards rewarding Treegen holders. 1M mangrove trees is only 6 carbon forward deals away from funding over 500B mangrove trees under this model.

 # Local Impact Example
 
 
 
 
 
 Broadfield Enterprises Uganda has catalyzed 1300 smallholder farmers in Sanje to successfully implement commercial permaculture. Community members plant permaculture agroforestry gardens with 3 export crops and 500 indigenous plant species. Their method results in transformational development of good soils, microclimate, and increased canopy cover. The farms establish local food and economic security, reduced waste and female-led cooperatives. Seven schools with 70,000+ pupils are learning permaculture through their curriculum, and they are scaling to another 100,000+ pupils. They recently formed a Permaculture Innovation Hub in partnership with Bloom and Africa First to support and educate local farmers with social entrepreneurship skills! By collaborating with Bloom Network, they are able to increase the global distribution of their coffee, find more business mentors, and augment their finance.

0xe2c2826f16d68804bd86b19178950e6f0ca891df3d3a7cc767a9549003346bae,Earthist - Decentralize the Seeds,"Earthist Network is a mission-driven project initiated in 2019, focusing on preserving heirloom seeds and promoting regenerative hemp farming. We combine natural farming with modern technology, aiming to create micro-processing centers for small and family hemp farmers, further bolstering regional economies and seed preservation efforts.
 
 
 
 *Our aim and impact:*
 
 
 
 **Seed Sovereignty** 
 
 Decentralize seed preservation, ensuring seeds are adaptable to local conditions, and empowering communities to take charge of their agricultural future.
 
 **Boost Regional Economies** 
 
 Through the establishment of micro-processing centers, small and family hemp farmers get resources and knowledge to process their produce, ensuring better profitability and lesser carbon emissions.
 
 **Promote Regeneration** 
 
 With an emphasis on hemp's environmental benefits and regenerative processing and packaging methods, our network advocates for eco-friendly agricultural practices and supports other initiatives
 
 **Educate and Engage**
 
 The project also strives to raise awareness about seed diversity's significance, hemp's potential, and the importance of regeneration.
 
 **DAO Operator Program**
 
 We have initiated the ""DAO Operator Program"" with BanklessDAO_TR to empower individuals to engage with decentralized organizations, complete tasks, and earn token payments. This program is designed to not only offer immediate opportunities but also to equip participants with the skills and experience needed to thrive in global DAOs.
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Aiming for Impact
 
 Earthist Network's project is about more than just agriculture; it's a movement towards a regenerative, and community-centric future. 
 
 We aim for a future where seeds remain accessible and diverse, protecting our planet's agricultural heritage and ensuring a regenerative food system for generations to come.
 
 
 
 **Significance of Seed Diversity**
 
 In the contemporary agricultural landscape, 75% of plant genetic diversity has been lost since the 1900s. Astonishingly, out of around 30,000 edible plant species globally, only 150 are cultivated, and a mere 30 provide the majority of our diets. Such a narrow focus on crop cultivation increases vulnerability to diseases, pests, and changing climate conditions, threatening global food security.
 
 **Decentralizing Seed Preservation**
 
 Centralized seed banks, although essential, are vulnerable to natural and political disruptions. The Earthist vision of decentralized seed banks disperses the responsibility of seed conservation. Utilizing blockchain technology, the initiative ensures traceability, authenticity, and security of seed data. The goal is not just to preserve seeds, but to make them accessible and adaptable to varied local conditions.
 
 
 
 **Rediscovering Heirloom Seeds**
 
 In 2019, we embarked on a mission to rediscover lost local heirloom seeds and created our first seed bank in 2022
 
 
 
 **The Role of Hemp**
 
 Hemp, often misjudged due to its association with cannabis, is a primary focus of Earthist endeavors. It grows rapidly, has myriad uses from textiles to medicine, and offers environmental benefits, including carbon sequestration.
 
 
 
 Our engagement with heirloom seeds involves a comprehensive chain of activities:
 
 Planting
 
 Harvesting
 
 Seed Collection
 
 Processing & Packaging

 ### Personal Introduction
 
 
 
 I‚Äôm [**Wasabi**](https://link3.to/wasabinetwork), founder at [**Kokonut Network**](https://kokonut.network/). We are building a bridge to connect web3 and agriculture. We are creating a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of coconut farms.
 
 
 
 Our main goal is to address the worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects. We help farmers get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by giving them access to perpetual natural assets.
 
 
 
 ### TL;DR
 
 
 
 Kokonut Network offers blockchain governance and open-source accounting services to the agricultural sector. Our mission is to encourage, organize, finance, and oversee coconut farms. We gather funds from the community using the Kokonut DAO framework to make decisions and distribute treasury funds.
 
 
 
 Kokonut Network can forge a lifelong partnership with its members through the Kokonut DAO, utilizing a combination of Agriculture, Blockchain, Web3, Soil, and Weather. This synergy has no expiration date, mirroring the fact that coconut trees are replanted when they cease to bear fruit.

 ## This is what you're helping bring to life
 
 
 
 ### Kokonut Five Dimensions of Impact
 
 1. **WHAT** ‚Äì The objective is to test our DAO thesis by building and developing a coconut plantation under the DAO model, which intersects real-life communities, web3 communities, and global culture. The outcome of this investment will create a perpetual asset that will improve people's lives in every aspect.
 
 2. **WHO** ‚Äì The families who own the land where the project will be developed are underserved in every aspect, including education, finances, health, and opportunities. In Latin America, jobs and the economy mainly function in big cities, and the countryside is typically marginalized or taken advantage of by large corporations. A blockchain-based co-op can help remove many of these barriers.
 
 3. **HOW MUCH** ‚Äì Approximately 60 families own the land, and the project will create 1,000 direct and indirect jobs. This will be life-changing for everyone involved, as it will provide opportunities and value for at least 20 years.
 
 4. **CONTRIBUTION** ‚Äì Underserved individuals depend on these types of projects and new concepts based on blockchain that open doors to new paradigms and possibilities. The current system's criteria and entry-level are very high, making it difficult for those who cannot meet their standards.
 
 5. **RISK** ‚Äì We have several fail safes in place, such as agricultural insurance, open-source cloud accounting systems, government and community oversight, and technical support from all government agencies involved in the project framework.

 # Why Kokonut Network?
 
 
 
 In essence, Kokonut Network serves as the coordination layer that harnesses the power of web3 and open-source technologies to craft an adaptable organism capable of limitless expansion, thanks to its modular plug-and-play design framework.
 
 
 
 Every component of our network is crafted in alignment with our core values: community first, work and access freedom, and respect for diverse opinions.
 
 
 
 Our commitment extends to safeguarding the interests of minorities through a comprehensive approach. Our approach is different, as evidenced by our roadmap.

 ### Why coconuts? 
 
 #### Zero Waste Circular By Default Crop ‚ôªÔ∏è
 
 
 
 Coconut is the most cultivated and vital palm tree in the world, as it is the main source of vegetable fat. It is one of the plants that provide a wide variety of products and by-products, serving as a primary source of food, drinks, and shelter for animals.
 
 
 
 The coconut products market size was valued at $11.5 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 13.6% from 2019 to 2026. In 2018, the coconut oil segment accounted for more than half of the total coconut products market share.
 
 
 
 Coconut is a versatile fruit with many health benefits. Its derivatives, such as coconut oil, water, milk, desiccated coconut, coir, and copra, are used in the food, beverage, cosmetic, and personal care industries.
 
 
 
 ### Kokonut V1 [Production Layer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüåæ]
 
 
 
 Our first plantation will yield 18 million coconuts annually, enabling us to generate multiple revenue streams in the food, health, and automotive industries.
 
 
 
 **Learn more:** *<https://kokonut.network/kokonut-v1>*
 
 
 
 ### **Kokonut DAO** [Governance Layer üó≥Ô∏è]
 
 
 
 ***The DAO is the core vehicle for all fundraising, rewards distributions, and governance decisions.***
 
 
 
 Kokonut Network is a platform built by and for people. At its core, Kokonut DAO seeks to empower anyone who adds value to the Kokonut Network ecosystem, regardless of their social status or prior accomplishments.
 
 
 
 **Learn more:** *<https://kokonut.network/dao>*
 
 
 
 ### **Our Vision**
 
 
 
 Kokonut Network was created to reduce the obstacles to agricultural development, and rural project funding, and democratize investment in real-world projects. We will use blockchain technology to establish multiple plantations across the country, providing advantages to the global crypto communities and everyone in the network.
 
 
 
 ### **What makes us different?**
 
 
 
 Kokonut Network has a distinct approach. Rather than establishing our proposal or business plan by taking advantage of our users, and attempting to get them to purchase some non-backed token, we have created a resilient system over time. It is backed by coconut plants on our land and has a DAO for governance, funds allocation, and rewards sharing.

0x717f0ec44bfface6e64c6b0c66021ce560c98e74152847a515c6591e4b1d50b5,FORK FOREST,"WHAT IS FORK FOREST?
 
 
 
 It is a ReFi initiative created late 2022 by members of Fork DAO¬π. It was immediately embraced by the community and helped the DAO's growth. Though it acts a separate entity, there is love and collaboration. An active presence of the community can be seen in the sold out NFT collection for the first project, the ReFi topic in the DAO's Telegram group and the weekly Twitter/X Spaces in the DAO's account, therefore creating ReFi content in spanish. Fork Forest is currently collaborating with other ReFi projects such as Ekonavi and GainForest.
 
 
 
 FORK FOREST 01
 
 
 
 The first project FORK FOREST 01 was assembled in January 2023 and successfully completed in May¬≤. We supported a local organisation called 'Zapam Zucum' by providing means of financiation and tools to link them with the community. We set up an NFT collection¬≥ and sold out. 100% of the money received at our first NFT campaign was directly dripped to 'Zapam Zucum'. We also onboarded 'Zapam Zupum' successfully‚Å¥, so they could open a hot wallet and use the funds without depending on anyone else. Thanks to all the efforts, we succesfully planted 50 native trees in an open reunion with the community and even members of the DAO travelling to be part. Works of ecological conservation were part of the job. It all ended with a festival with local bands at sunset.
 
 
 
 FORK FOREST 02
 
 
 
 For this second project, we are addressing an important problem in Argentina: improper use of agrochemicals. We are addressing the same region as the first project‚Åµ, bonding strongly with the local community.
 
 
 
 The region is the Traslasierras Valley in the province of Cordoba, in Argentina. We are working with an Agricultural Engineer who's a High school teacher in a small town called Los Cerrilos. We met Ing. Fernando Parra in our first project, since we purchased native trees from his production. This town is suffering the consequences of the poor use of agrochemicals, and we intend to help.
 
 
 
 The project is a 10km¬≤ forestal curtain mainly composed by native trees. Helped by the tools of GainForest, we can also measure all the benefits that a native forest brings to the world, and put value in a formerly forgotten area. 
 
 
 
 We are aiming to cover the first of the three stages, the first of three stages of the forestal curtain. This will take place in mid september in a collaboration with the commune of Los Cerrillos‚Å∂ and with the presence and support of INTA‚Å∑ (Argentina's National Institute of Agricultural Technology).

0x9575cc4fc36454d4fd20fe68f980a72247e115363927b4ffba3a59f713f65351,Silvi,"Silvi is contributing to the trillion tree target by building financial and coordination tools for hyperlocal reforestation.
 
  
 
 We are building a protocol with the following tools and features:
 
  
 
 üí∞‚è≥ **TreeForwards** - Every TreeForward, at its core, is a distinct bond that provides not only the backing for a tree but a commitment to its holistic contribution to the ecosystem. This budget is a tree commitment that is released as milestone-based rewards to incentivize tree stewardship
 
 
 
 üìçüî≠ **Extreme traceability** and attribution of new trees, not just for accountability and inventorying, but to unleash the community effects needed for tree-planting to become a thing!
 
  
 
 üìíüßÆ **Batch Accounting**: Silvi's robust batch accounting system efficiently manages groupings of TreeForwards, ensuring that each tree within a batch receives its requisite funding and care. This feature enhances scalability, ensuring large-scale reforestation initiatives with area based accounting are as meticulously managed as individual trees as well as for pre-planting propagation and logistics.
 
 
 
 üìãüìà**Adaptive Methodologies**: A proprietary app functions as the nexus between conservation strategies and their tangible outcomes, ushering in an era of precise, adaptive reforestation.
 
 
 
  
 
 üó∫Ô∏è üß∫Portfolio Management: Embodying the democratization of reforestation, we believe that global efforts should be cohesively managed and brokered.
 
 
 
  
 
 üìñ üå≥OpenTrees Initiative: Beyond a mere data model, this is Silvi's clarion call for collaborative, transparent, and standards-driven reforestation.
 
 
 
  
 
 Let's unpack that üëÜ
 
  
 
 **Tree Forwards:**
 
 Silvi is collateralizing the net present value of New Trees. Further, tree investments are low risk instruments because they are performance-based payouts depended on verifiable milestones. 
 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/IgNyZYw.png)
 
 
 
 Tree forwards define the unit economics of reforestation but because there are 50-60k tree species, tree forward claims are themselves tied to species and location-specific methodologies. For this Silvi is supporting a p2p library of species-specific methodologies. Think of it as tree wikis for tree science and a participatory model for the ground work/truth üëá
 
  
 
 **Ground truth and MRV:**
 
 Our focus has been on building a stack to serve the human-centric stages of the tree lifecycle while setting a strong and reliable foundation from which other Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) can happen. V1 of our app incorporated the registering of trees and saplings. For v2 of the app which was launched in the last Gitcoin grant, we have completed IPFS, Tree data NFTs, claim settlement payout contracts and also started work on methodology smart contracts.
 
  
 
 Interface:
 
 Silvi has been building an app where we're leveraging social media mechanics with citizen science frameworks to develop a Pokemon-Go-like experience for gamified tree planting and stewardship ![](https://i.imgur.com/4P7RVc3.jpg)
 
 ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJoOYHVnn.png)
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Further, We're collaborating with Orgs such as Ecolabs, dMeter, Athena and Regen Network on a Filecoin grant to deliver Claim Resolution for reforestation claims. Further, we'd like to collaborate and interop with other projects and technologies on techniques for statistical sampling of ground truth as well as remote sensing inference. And ultimately, we'd like to vertically integrate with carbon-certifying projects. 
 
  
 
 **Tokenomics:**
 
 Our long term plans involve launching a native governance token issued through tree commitments. Governance tokens will spawn utility NFT pairs that contain all the data and contracts for each tree.
 
 
 
 **Pilots:**
 
 To date, Silvi has already deployed several pilots:
 
 
 
 In the United States we've partnered with Fire Flies Forest Festival to plant 5 hardwood species and pines in a retired golf course in Tennessee as well as an Agroforestry planting in Miami.
 
 
 
 We've also partnered with Sustainacities, a netzero toolkit working with Miami to validate our Urban Theory of Change that we can grow more trees in the cities by directly compensating citizens to be agents.
 
 
 
 However, Silvi's biggest focus is currently in Kenya, where it is connecting communities such as schools and small holder farmers to Kenya's last rainforest, Kakamega forest. Silvi is building a methodology to help establish small, distributed nursery beds around the forest with the goal of improving supply of saplings. ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0nniCy.png)
 
 With the help of Gitcoin funding, Silvi has established operations in a dozen schools and 30+ small holder farmers and propagated more than 100k trees from seed. The project is in close conversation with the Forestry services and the Forest-run nurseries because Silvi is helping expand capacity of reforestation via its theory of change that a greater number of independent nurseries run by community members via a participatory model will help increase capacity and coordination. Silvi is close to being assigned an exclusive area for planting and forest management where our MRV and methodology will be put to the test over the following years.

 **Partners**:
 
 We're so happy to be part of dMeter where other awesome dMRV projects like EcoLabs, Athena, Avano, Interform, Ogallala and Orgo are working together to solve planetary restoration and natural capital creation! We're partnering with Ecolabs and AgroForestDAO on the development of an agroforestry methodology and with Sunflower Ecotech (Formerly Ecolabs) on a nursery pilot in Barichara, Colomboia who we recently won first prize for OpenTrees, a structured tree data submission we applied to Filecoin's Sustainable Blockchain hackathon. We're also proud to be supported by Celo and the Climate Collective and incorporating Celo's stables for payouts in Kenya. We are also partnered with Good Collective who are leveraging our methodologies to distribute conditional UBI to stewards on the ground. And we just recently partnered with Blkburd Genes to plant trees for every tshirt they sell.
 
 
 
 Please reach out to us if you or anyone you know would like to be an early adopter of our tools and methodology towards hyperlocal reforestation"

 # **TL;DR:**
 
 
 
 üåª **Vision ‚Üí Mission ‚Üí Goal ‚Üí** We envision a future where humanity's capacity to regenerate ecosystems surpasses the rate at which we degrade them. To turn this vision into reality, our mission is to transform regeneration into an occupation. Our immediate goal is to streamline the onboarding process into Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and make the verification of small-scale impact both feasible and cost-effective.
 
 
 
 ### **But why ‚ùî**
 
 
 
 üö® The planet's ecosystems are under threat, with degradation outpacing regeneration. Small-scale regenerators hold the key to reversing this trend, but face barriers like the high costs of originating environmental assets and complex, fragmented onboarding processes in the ReFi space. We're bridging the gap, enabling regenerators to earn a living through tangible impact.
 
 
 
 ### **So, what are we actually building ‚ùî**
 
 
 
 üèóÔ∏è You may be familiar with our previous gitcoin grant (The Impact App + Eco Labs), we are still working on many of the same things, but we‚Äôve since rebranded to Sunflower EcoTech. We're embracing hope and optimism, shining a light on the path to tackle planetary challenges head-on. To that end, we‚Äôre working on several interconnected projects that will progress our goals:
 
 
 
 1Ô∏è‚É£ **RegenID:** A dApp designed to simplify and enhance the onboarding process for regenerators looking to make an income from verifying their regenerative practices. By leveraging decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), RegenID provides a secure and transparent mechanism for individuals and entities to establish their identity and credentials in the regenerative finance ecosystem. This tool is an evolution of our earlier initiative, The Impact App, and will serve many of the same functions. Read beyond the tldr to learn how this will be used for web3/ReFi onboarding, reputation-sensing, and as a ‚ÄúBioregional Passport‚Äù
 
 
 
 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Adaptive Agroforestry & Smallholder Stewardship:** A pioneering methodology that facilitates the issuance of eco credits on Regen Network, enabling small-scale regenerators to originate practice-based, environmental stewardship credits from verified regenerative practices like Syntropic Agroforestry in diverse bioregions across the globe.
 
 
 
 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Bio-acoustic Sensor + OpenSource Models:** An innovative device that employs AI for biodiversity assessment. Capable of detecting the distinct acoustic signatures of myriad species, it offers a low-cost, digital measurement of biodiversity and indicator that regenerative practices are occuring.
 
 
 
 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Methodology Development as a Service (MDaaS):** Beyond our own methodologies, we extend our expertise to partners and collaborators, aiding in the creation of methodologies specific to diverse regenerative practices.
 
 
 
 ### **Where will your funds go ‚ùî**
 
 
 
 ü™ô Your contribution and the subsequent matching funds will be deployed to fund the continued development of these four projects in addition to funding our collaborators & specific pilot projects. We will be splitting our proceeds up like this:
 
 
 
 **10% to [RefaiSicilia](https://www.rifaisicilia.com/)**
 
 - this event will be a real world catalyst for our projects. Over 5 days we‚Äôll be working with current & potential regenerators in a fire-devastated, underpopulated region of Sicily to scope out how our Adaptive Agroforestry eco credits could function in this environment.
 
 
 
 **10% to [Barichara Pilot Projects](https://www.regeneratebarichara.org/)**
 
 - from funding the creation of a tree nursery with our partner Silvi Protocol to testing technologies in the field with many project sites funded by the Barichara Regeneration Fund.
 
 
 
 **10% to [dMeter](https://twitter.com/dMeter4dmrv)**
 
 - at the heart of solving proof-of-impact at small-scales is something called dMRV (digital, decentralized, Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) and dMeter is at the heart of interoperability and collaboration in dMRV. 
 
 
 
 **70% to the Sunflower core team**
 
 - [Sev](https://twitter.com/SevNightingale), [Samantha](https://twitter.com/samanthayintan), [Nathaniel](https://twitter.com/nathanielstern), [Jill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adaburrows/), & [Jessica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-lisiewski-20a6bba/), to help us continue to execute on all of the above initiatives. 
 
 
 
 **So join us in this journey of regeneration. Every contribution brings us one step closer to collaboratively accelerating humanity's capacity to regenerate ecosystems faster than we degrade them<3** üôèüôèüôè
 
 
 
 
 
 # **FULL LENGTH GRANT:**
 
 
 
 ## **Why you should care about what we‚Äôre working on**
 
 
 
 üåª Amidst the looming shadow of planetary collapse and the vast ""metacrisis"", many feel daunted. Yet, we stand firm in hope and optimism. Our evolution from Eco Labs to Sunflower EcoTech is more than a name change; it's a symbol of resilience, growth, and a brighter future. Here‚Äôs why this is so important:
 
 
 
 ### üå± The Reality of Our Times
 
 - The world is at a crossroads. Climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental challenges are not just abstract concepts; they are real, tangible threats that affect our daily lives. From wildfires to droughts, from rising sea levels to extreme weather events, the signs are all around us.
 
 
 
 ### üå± The Power of Individual Action
 
 - While these challenges are vast, history has shown us that collective individual actions can bring about monumental change. Every regenerator, every tree planted, every sustainable practice adopted, contributes to a larger movement. A movement that isn't just about survival, but about thriving and coexisting harmoniously with nature.
 
 
 
 ### üå± The Ripple Effect of Systemic Change
 
 - At the heart of our challenges lie systems and incentives that have long prioritized short-term gains over long-term sustainability. By reshaping these systems and realigning incentives, we catalyze profound, lasting impact. When we support regenerative practices, we're not merely addressing symptoms; we're transforming the underlying structures that govern behavior. This systemic shift not only restores the environment but also revitalizes communities, creates sustainable livelihoods, and fosters a culture of care and responsibility. Such deep-rooted changes have the power to influence economies, societies, and set the course for future generations on a path of harmony and abundance.
 
 
 
 ### üå± Innovation as Our Ally
 
 - In the age of technology, we have tools at our disposal that our ancestors could only dream of. Leveraging technology for environmental good, such as blockchain, IoT, and AI, amplifies our impact and accelerates our progress. It's a fusion of nature's wisdom and human ingenuity.
 
 
 
 ### üå± A Call to Hope
 
 - While the challenges are immense, so too are the opportunities. Every crisis in history has been met with innovation, resilience, and the indomitable human spirit. We invite you to be part of this hopeful narrative, to be a beacon of change, and to join us in sowing the seeds for a regenerative future.
 
 
 
 ## **What we‚Äôve been up to the last year**
 
 
 
 ### üåé **Our Journey in Colombia**
 
 
 
 Over the past year, our team immersed ourselves in Barichara, Colombia for a total of five transformative months. Our first trip began at ReFi Barichara, a five-day event organized by regenerative collaborators Joe Brewer and Antonio, in partnership with the local organization, the Barichara Territorial Foundation. This experience grounded us in the reality of regeneration and fostered beautiful relationships with local regenerators. We engaged with the local community, learning about diverse regenerative projects, volunteering and getting our hands dirty in the field which helped us identify three pilot sites for our methodology:
 
 
 
 **Bioparque M√≥ncora** - this community forest is a 6.5-hectare symbol of regenerative cooperation.
 
 
 
 **Huerta Communitaria** - a 2-hectare project in syntropic agroforestry fosters community connection and local economy.
 
 
 
 **Origen del Agua** - a 3.2-hectare reforestation project that focuses on water retention, soil-building, and native forest growth.
 
 
 
 This hands-on experience gave us invaluable insights into the realities of regeneration and the potential for small-scale regenerators to make a significant impact.
 
 
 
 During our second trip, we delved into the practical application of digital, decentralized Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) tools. We collaborated with [Gainforest](https://gainforest.earth/) to collect ecological data, capturing drone footage and recording species data. We realized the need for a low cost sensor that maximizes ecological data collection, striking that balance lead us to partner with [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/) to co-develop a low-cost bio-acoustic sensor. These tools promise to revolutionize the way we measure and verify regenerative practices, making it easier and more affordable for regenerators to demonstrate their impact.
 
 
 
 This trip helped us solidify our understanding of applied dMRV, and now we continue to develop our capacity to implement dMRV techniques in these categories:
 
 
 
 ü§≥ **Human Sensing:** Data collected through humans using smartphones.
 
 
 
 üõ∞Ô∏è **Remote Sensing:** Data collected through IoT devices, drones, and satellite imagery.
 
 
 
 üìõ **Reputation Sensing:** Data that shows the relationship and association between projects, the regenerators that steward them, and the local community and economy.
 
 
 
 ## **Market Research with NSF**
 
 
 
 Between our immersive trips to Colombia, we conducted comprehensive market research through the [National Science Foundation iCorps program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps). This initiative involved conducting over 140 stakeholder interviews, providing us with a profound understanding of the ecological assets market. Our interviewees ranged from Corporate Sustainability Officers and Philanthropic donors to Asset Managers and Founders.
 
 
 
 Our research led us to categorize ""Patrons"" into three distinct groups, each with different investment horizons:
 
 
 
 ‚ñ™Ô∏è**Short-term stakeholders: Philanthropists and Speculators**
 
 
 
 - Philanthropists: These are individuals or organizations with a big heart and the financial means to support regenerative causes. They are driven by a desire to contribute to environmental sustainability.
 
 
 
 - Speculators: This group includes investors and traders who are interested in purchasing eco assets with the intention of reselling them later at a premium to medium and long-term buyers. They see immediate opportunity in the market and are ready to invest in eco assets for future gains.
 
 
 
 ‚óæ**Medium-term stakeholders: Commodity Producers and Insurance Providers**
 
 
 
 - Commodity Producers: These stakeholders view regenerative practices as a means of risk mitigation. Climate change poses existential threats to supply chains, and regenerative practices can increase biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, decreasing the risk of climate disruption. Commodities like Coffee, Olive Oil, Cacao, Citrus Fruits, Hemp, and others could be sold at a premium with proof-of-impact or eco assets attached to them.
 
 
 
 - Insurance Providers: Similar to commodity producers, insurance providers see value in regenerative practices for risk mitigation. The ecological data collected through regenerative practices can be resold to insurance underwriters to better predict natural disaster impacts.
 
 
 
 ‚¨õ **Long-term stakeholders: Corporates and Governments**
 
 
 
 Corporates and Governments: These entities are currently focusing more on Insetting (changing operations to reduce negative environmental impact) rather than Offsetting (buying eco assets that offset negative impact). There is a lack of clarity on what qualifies as Offsetting, and global standards bodies and government regulators need to achieve clarity on acceptable ecological assets. However, many corporations and governments have set sustainability goals for 2030 and 2040. As these dates approach, and if these organizations have not entirely reduced their negative impacts, they will need to purchase offsets to achieve goals like net-zero emissions. These stakeholders are considered long-term, not incredibly viable right now, but will become more so as we get closer to 2028 and beyond.
 
 
 
 ü¶úü´éüêù A key insight from our research was the [growing momentum of biodiversity credits](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Biodiversity_Credit_Market_2022.pdf). This emerging eco asset, which extends beyond the traditional focus on carbon, is gaining significant momentum and is poised for substantial growth in the coming years.
 
 
 
 ## **Notable Achievements**
 
 
 
 - [Sustainable Blockchain Hackathon](https://sbsboston.devpost.com/) Victory: We teamed up with our friends at FarmOS & Silvi to participate in the Sustainable Blockchain Hackathon, and we won! Our collaborative project, OpenTrees, is an open-source initiative that aims to create a standardized data model for trees. This standardization is crucial for research, conservation efforts, investment decisions, and transparency in reforestation projects.
 
 
 
 - [Future Quest Grants Recognition](https://medium.com/futurequest/grant-pool-winners-selected-ae24c1f40de6): We were honored to be one of the first 17 winners of the Future Quest grants. This achievement reflects our commitment to innovation and sustainability in the field of regenerative practices.
 
 
 
 ## **How we Work**
 
 
 
 At Sunflower EcoTech, we firmly believe in the power of collaboration to achieve our goals. We prioritize working with anyone and everyone who‚Äôs contributing to the puzzle of regeneration. This collaborative spirit has led us to run a methodology development sprint with individuals like Djimo from Silvi, Diogo from [Agroforest DAO](https://twitter.com/agroforestDAO), Ana Maria from [KoKo DAO](https://twitter.com/kokodaoxyz), Darina from [Coffee Impact Collective](https://twitter.com/coffeeimpactco), and Charlie from [ReCommon](https://twitter.com/ReCommon_Land). We've also participated in the Ecological Benefits Activator hosted by the [Lexicon](https://www.thelexicon.org/) and collaborated on designing a [‚ÄúWiki Page‚Äù for ReFi](https://www.notion.so/ecolabs/ReFi-Regenerative-Finance-aa0d1b4002384bbfb28bc0aedb89f951) with [ReFi DAO](https://www.refidao.com/) and the [Blockchain x Climate Leadership Network](https://bxc.network/) (BxC). While collaboration can be challenging to manage and progress, we believe it is essential to our mission of making regeneration an occupation, where Regenerators become the jobs of the future.
 
 
 
 In our pursuit of this regenerative future, we have forged key collaborations that enhance our ability to verify and originate Eco Credits:
 
 
 
 ü§ù **[Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/):** a platform that emphasizes high-integrity carbon and biodiversity credits. We are building on top of Regen Network's infrastructure, working closely with their team, organizing events with them, participating in their community and ecosystem governance, and assisting others in navigating Regen Network's methodology development process. This collaboration also facilitates the development of our own methodology, titled Adaptive Agroforestry & Smallholder Stewardship, aligning with Regen Network's mission to incentivize ecosystem regeneration and reverse climate change.
 
 
 
 ü§ù **[dMeter](https://twitter.com/dMeter4dmrv) Membership:** As a founding organizational member of dMeter, we are integrating decentralized Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) techniques such as human-sensing, remote-sensing, and reputation-sensing. These innovative methods provide a low-cost, decentralized source of ground-truth data, vital for the issuance of Eco Credits.
 
 
 
 ü§ù **[Silvi](https://www.silvi.earth/) Protocol Collaboration:** Working with Silvi Protocol, creators of a human-sensing mobile app for tree planting tracking, we are building on their technology to enhance our dMRV stack. This partnership makes our process more efficient in verifying and originating Eco Credits.
 
 
 
 ü§ù **[Digital Gaia](https://www.digitalgaia.earth/) Integration:** Our collaboration with Digital Gaia involves weaving our methodology into their active inference and digital twins system. This ensures that our Eco Credits will be associated with a Digital Gaia FERN score from the outset. Together, we are crafting UI/UX tools for Regenerators, modeling regenerative practices, and supporting our shared mission.
 
 
 
 ü§ù **[GainForest](https://gainforest.earth/) Collaboration:** In partnership with GainForest, we are enhancing the verification layer of MRV by utilizing their open-source models for satellite-based tree and vegetation assessment. Additionally, we are collaborating to develop novel bioacoustic models for recognizing species, further enriching our verification capabilities.
 
 
 
 ü§ù **[Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/):** one of the world's leading open-source hardware companies. They specialize in hardware research, production, and sales, particularly in the field of innovative IoT technology. We‚Äôve partnered with them to co-develop our bio-acoustic sensor device.
 
 
 
 ## **What we‚Äôve got planned for the next year**
 
 
 
 ### üìó **RegenID: Empowering Regenerative Land Stewards**
 
 
 
 [RegenID](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/106791) is a digital platform designed to onboard millions of environmental stewards, or ""Regenerators,"" into the world of Regenerative Finance and web3. By leveraging a multi-chain wallet, digital identifiers (DIDs), and issuing Bioregional Passports (a form of verifiable credentials or VCs), RegenID aims to help validate skills, build trust within communities, and facilitate fair payments for ecological asset sales. More than just a tool, RegenID serves as a pathfinder.
 
 
 
 Regenerator pathways are a core function of RegenID, serving as an index to guide Regenerators on available options for getting paid to make a positive impact. These pathways provide guidance on how and where to start taking action and where to get educated on regenerative practices. We are building a database of projects that include existing systems for paying people for positive action. This database will detail how people can get started in those projects, and what personality traits, skills, geography, and access to resources make an individual well-suited for a specific project. By asking a would-be Regenerator a few key questions, we can narrow down the options and display only the most relevant projects tailored to them specifically.
 
 
 
 The Bioregional Passport feature will serve as a recognized and verifiable system to acknowledge the skills, reputation, and contributions of Regenerators across various bioregions. By filling the gap in community accountability measures, RegenID aims to restore public trust in the carbon credit and ecological asset market, which has been eroded by instances of exploitation by external actors.
 
 
 
 This approach will incentivize reputable community regenerators to participate in ecological asset markets, providing eco-credit buyers with the necessary information to ensure their investments support genuine, community-rooted regeneration projects over global corporatized project developers with no real connection to the local economy. Use cases for Bioregional Passports include:
 
 
 
 **Reputation Sensing:** Revealing disconnects from the community.
 
 
 
 **Onboarding and Tracking Eco Assets:** Facilitating the process of integrating ecological assets.
 
 
 
 **Empowering Volunteers and Traveling Regenerators:** Facilitating a peer-to-peer system to issue badges that recognize skills and experiences.
 
 
 
 **Tracking Regen Experts and Consultants:** Monitoring their impact on projects over time.
 
 
 
 **Engaging Patrons and Contributors:** Facilitating eco-tourism and tracking contributions to regenerative projects, rewarding funding milestones with unique opportunities.
 
 
 
 ### üå≥ **Adaptive Agroforestry & Smallholder Stewardship (AASS) Methodology**
 
 
 
 We're developing and implementing the [Adaptive Agroforestry & Smallholder Stewardship](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6XKjg-XM1vyqvySKWsgP6l2zkF0NH9PwQr6WJhP0Hs/edit?usp=sharing) (AASS) methodology to assist smallholder farmers in adopting agroforestry practices. The methodology is adaptive and flexible, allowing for customization based on varying agro-ecological contexts. It focuses on practice-based eco-credits, with the potential for future outcomes-based credit issuance as carbon and biodiversity modeling can be performed on the collected data over time.
 
 
 
 Our monitoring approach will use a combination of decentralized, digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) solutions, applying the concept of Data Fidelity. This means eco-credits may be issued with varying levels of certainty, from low-fidelity (one form of sensing technique) to high-fidelity (all sensing techniques present and cross-referenced).
 
 
 
 Over the next year, we plan to develop and implement this methodology, which is based on observations from on-the-ground agroforestry projects around the world, including locations in Barichara Colombia, Ndula Zambia, and Lima Duarte Brasil.
 
 
 
 ### üéôÔ∏è **Bio-acoustic Sensor + OpenSource Models**
 
 
 
 At Sunflower Ecological Technologies, we're developing and training new AI models that can accurately recognize the calls of thousands of distinct animal species across diverse bioregions and ecological conditions. We're building on the success of existing technologies, such as [BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/) from Cornell University, and developing novel models to recognize other key species including insects, bats, frogs, and mammals.
 
 
 
 Our plan for the coming year is structured around four main objectives: Developing and Incorporating New AI models, Training and Testing AI models, Creating a Biodiversity Assessment Model, and Comparative Field Testing. After developing a working prototype, we‚Äôll work closely with Seeed Studio to develop a scalable, mass manufacturable version of the sensor able to be deployed to thousands of small farms around the world at a low & accessible cost. We're excited about the potential of this project to revolutionize biodiversity assessment. By leveraging AI and decentralized, digital MRV solutions, we aim to provide a scalable and efficient solution for biodiversity assessment that can be used across multiple ecosystems and bioregions.
 
 
 
 ### üßë‚Äçüíª **Methodology Development as a Service (MDaaS)**
 
 
 
 In the upcoming year, we are partnering with [Freight to Plate](https://www.ftp.farm/) to develop a unique methodology that quantifies the ecological benefits of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA). This methodology will be specifically tailored to capture the impact of their hydroponic container farms.
 
 
 
 CEA, also known as indoor farming, is a revolutionary approach to agriculture that allows for precise control of environmental conditions, leading to improved crop yields and lower production costs. However, the ecological benefits of this method are not well-documented or quantified, which is where our methodology comes in.
 
 
 
 Our goal is to create a comprehensive measurement framework that captures the full range of ecological benefits provided by CEA. This includes factors such as water and energy efficiency, reduction in pesticide use, and the potential for carbon sequestration. By doing so, we aim to provide a clear and compelling case for the environmental benefits of CEA, thereby encouraging its wider adoption.
 
 
 
 This project is part of our broader initiative to offer Methodology Development as a Service. We believe that by helping organizations like Freight to Plate quantify their ecological impact, we can drive the adoption of more sustainable practices across the agricultural sector. This, in turn, will contribute to our overall mission of promoting regenerative practices and ecological stewardship.
 
 
 
 ## **In conclusion**
 
 
 
 At Sunflower EcoTech, our principles of regeneration, collaboration, diversity, and transparency guide us. We prioritize the needs of regenerators, those on the frontlines of ecological restoration, and strive to create tools and methodologies that support and validate their invaluable work.
 
 
 
 We embrace collaboration, value radical truth and transparency, and prioritize action. We're not just building products; we're fostering a community that seeks to understand and address the complexities of our world.

 # Why support us?
 
 
 
 *Problem to Solve*
 
 
 
 **Endangered trees** are responsible for maintaining the health of most of the world's **endangered forest ecosystems**, but rarely produce relevant revenue for landowners (without being damaged) and even become **financial liabilities**, thus encouraging their ilegal felling. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *Endangered Tokens‚Äô Solution*
 
 
 
 **Leverage web3** and **digital art** to incentivize the protection of these **scarce** beings by changing their status from merely the cost of maintaining a tree to a **revenue producing Bio-Asset**.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Mission
 
 
 
 To **ensure the protection** of endangered trees by bestowing them with **tangible value** in society.
 
 
 
 ## Vision 
 
 
 
 To create a world where endangered and long lived trees are **not only preserved** but also revered for their **intrinsic value**, fostering a harmonious **coexistence** between **nature and society**.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 ### How will we accomplish this?
 
 
 
 
 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/laF4AmK.png) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 **Endangered Tokens** is a **ReFi & DeSci NFT** community looking to revalue biodiversity by **tokenizing georeferenced endangered trees**. Each specimen is characterized and video recorded alongside a small verse description, and when owning one, you **become the godfather of a scarce endangered tree**!
 
 With the funds raised we will help landowners finance the **protection of endangered Forest** with **reforestation**, verification of **carbon credits** from the forests and the creation of quality **digital content & data** to add value to the tokens, content like:
 
 
 
 
 
 * **Inmersive UX for ReFi Assets**, to engage with web3 enthusiasts and show the value of each token **as seen in real life**.
 
 * **3D tourism experience** of the protected forests thus **reducing the footprint** of real life tourism while also generating a continuous flow of revenue to **keep supporting the protection of the forests**. 
 
 * Using the 3D replicas of each tree as a virtual asset for **video games** and/or **augmented reality** experiences
 
 * **Recording data** from the forest for research and enhanced digital experiences like music from the frequencies of the trees, **bioacoustics**, video recording of the ecosystems, **climate data**, water flow, among other relevant information.
 
 
 
 
 
 NFT holders will receive a portion of the revenue that will come from the NFT Sales, tourism experiences, data management and carbon credits, thus converting endangered trees from liabilities to ***biodiversity assets for the future***. 
 
 
 
 We are also developing a new type of Credit Class for Old Grown Trees (OGT credit Class) so any type of big tree can become a way of proving your positive impact in the world and a way of financing its protection, instead of cutting them down for wood. Details in projects below.

 ### Which kind of trees are we talking about?
 
 
 
 We are currently working in **Chile** in South america, with the rare species [***Gomortega Keule***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomortega), or locally known as Queule. This magnificent beings are the last one of the *Gomortegacae* Family, dating its evolution to ***Pangea*** times. It is estimated that there are no more than 4000 specimens alive in the world! (*Scarcer than Bitcoin!*)
 
 
 
 
 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/YsQ5Heb.jpg)
 
 
 
 
 
 With the help of past Gitcoin Grants we are also making contacts and reviewing possible projects with the Brazilian Tree **""Pau Brasil"" or [Paubrasilia echinata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paubrasilia)** an endangered Species of tree from which the country got it's name! The heavily abused lumbering by portuguese conquerors depleted their population and nowadays is a rare and unique living being. 
 
 
 
 We are developing a roadmap of species to keep onboarding, like Alerce, Pitao, Araucaria, Baobab, Sequoia, and others. 
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 ### How will grant funding has been/will be spent?
 
 
 
 As of the date of this 18th round of Gitcoin Grants (#GG18 lets go!) we have raised around 21000 DAI through Gitcoin that we have spent cautiously and also have some saved for our roadmap goals. Without Gitcoin this project would not be able to keep moving forward as we have. We thank every supporter and every sponsor of the Climate Rounds. 
 
 
 
 Things we have invested until now and will continue to invest: 
 
 
 
 **1. Project development** (Priority)
 
 
 
 Develop the products, contracts and DAPPs necessary to ensure mission fulfilment, growth and engagement. See ongoing projects for further detail. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 **2. Vital activities core team funding**
 
 - [x] General administration
 
 - [x] Coding and development
 
 - [x] Marketing and community growth
 
 - [x] NGO's and landowners coordination
 
 - [x] Content creation and production
 
 
 
 
 
 **3. Endangered Tokens Conservation program**
 
 
 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/SvRnym7.png)
 
 * Tokenization, extensive cadastre & landowner agreements
 
 * in-situ conservation actions to reduce threats. 
 
 * Ex-situ conservation actions and landscape restoration actions
 
 * Sustainable local development & community engagement
 
 * Research on species and their habitats
 
 * Carbon Bonds verification, trading and retirement
 
 
 
 **4. Marketing and community building**
 
 
 
 We have realized that a crypto community needs to be active, engaged and in constant growth in order to stay healthy. This is an important pillar of investment on top of a marketing lead within the team. Among other things, we have attended several Crypto Conferences creating network and alliances with important crypto and ReFi Actors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 **5. Decentralization**
 
 
 
 One of the challenges faced has been to improve decentralization within the projects. Part of the funds will go to improve decentralization each round.
 
 
 
 **6. Equipment**
 
 
 
 In order to experiment, record, experience and iterate on our products we have invested in technology like the Plantsplay device, HD Camera, Meta Oculus Quest 2 and looking to purchase a 360¬∞ action cam for content creation within the forest.

 * ## Production and development of the first WEB3 virtual reality touristic *Endangered Forest* experience.
 
 
 
 We have been developing this project for almost a year, but got delayed in the middle for lack of funds and other inconvenients. We expect to have the first MVP by september available to be experienced in Meta Oculus Quest 2 or similar.

  * ### ENTS DAPP: Decentralized Proof-of-Tree registering & incentives DAPP & Public Registry Map for Endangered Trees
 
 
 
 One of the challenges we've faced on our journey is to keep updated on-chain data to verify an Endangered tree is actually alive. With decentralization, smartphones and a well designed DAPP we can connect incentives with tasks on the field to discover, register, content capture, tokenize and give living proof-of-tree for valuable specimen, keeping token holders updated on their collected ENTS aswell as landwoners incetivized to preserve them.

 1st Minting December 2022 
 
 2nd Mint TBA
 
 This Pixel Art token will grant you access (hence it is and Entry) to the Alpha Release of the Ecosystem UX in development. The purpose of this be able to grow the community further than only the available tokenized Endangered trees (That are really scarce to produce many!)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 * ### Old Grown trees Credit Class Development (OGT Credits)
 
 
 
 In order to fully convert our protected trees to biodiversity Assets we thought a way to represent them as credits. The OGT Credits system allows landowners to register their Old Grown Trees through the ENTS DAPP, a user-friendly application. Once registered, these trees transform into 'credits' based on their age and conservation status. Landowners can then monetize these credits, creating a compelling economic reason to preserve these trees.

 * #### Ecosystem UX development
 
 
 
 For two years we have been thinking the best way to make interact the Endangered Tokens User with their Endangered trees Collectibles. We believe the User Experience can make a difference in the value of a token. Combining previous developments we are on the road to creating a unique experience.
 
 
 
 As a player of Ecosystem UX, you can collect and plant rare and georeferenced tokenized trees as NFTs, earn rewards, and interact with other players from around the world. These trees are not just any trees; they are rare and endangered species that need our help to survive. By collecting these trees, players contribute to the conservation of these species, learn about their unique characteristics, and help preserve the biodiversity of our planet.

 Using Unreal Engine 5 we have modeled so far 10 of the 25 tokenized Queules. The first product that is ready-to-launch from this is the Queule 3D showroom to explore the modeled trees as a virtual experience.
 
 
 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/kC1REa1.png)
 
 
 
 We are developing a Virtual Reality Experience of the Endangered Queule Forest as a product to offer to our holders and also to Scale our ReFi Model.

 ## ‚ò∏Ô∏èüéµüé∂üéµMusic of the ENTSüéµüé∂üéµ
 
 
 
 Alongside the virtual experience we are recording the frequencies of the endangered trees through a PlantsPlay device (www.plantsplay.com) as the first approach. Our vision is to be able to stream the music of the endangered trees live, so they can produce their own content to help them stay alive.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## DeSci projects to be developed
 
 
 
 #### Bio-Acoustic MRV
 
 In order to understand the forest better, we need to learn how its sounds speaks regarding the health of the forest.This way we will be able to use a cheap and effective MRV for our forests and contribute to the ReFi community with more tools and infrastructure for better MRVs
 
 Landmarks: We have already conversation with a PhD Student of bio-acoustic and we are collaborating with [:link:Dmeter DMRV](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7064/decentralized-monitoring-reporting-and-verificati) to develop this MRV alternative. 
 
 
 
 #### Dendrochronology of longlivedtrees to understand climate change.
 
 
 
 With the proper tools and scientific proffesionals measuring the age of longlived trees and its roots can help us understand more about their endangered situation.

0x286af24f3b1316938a5a7a37d4e9a61f2338c55dc1ad278b88220f0ee48ae980,PlantGang,"## PlantGang is a decentralised community of citizen scientists dedicated to protecting and immortalising nature through 3D scanned scientific NFT specimen collections.
 
 
 
 We‚Äôre using cutting edge 3D modelling technologies to build **the first Virtual Herbarium**, a scientifically accurate collection of immersive 3D models of real-world scanned plant and fungi specimens, led by a decentralised community of researchers and citizen scientists.
 
 
 
 Plantgang‚Äôs virtual herbarium platform will provide the support and technical 3D processing capabilities for our community, using basic tech such as a smartphone, to collect scientific data and scan real-world plant specimens.
 
 
 
 After simply uploading a short video of their chosen plant specimen to the Virtual Herbarium, PlantGang will use 3D modelling technologies (NeRF and Photogrammetry) to generate photoreal 3D model specimens.
 
 
 
 Our new research economy is underpinned by allowing citizen scientists scanners to sell their uploaded 3D specimens as open collectible NFTs. Funds from NFT collectible sales are transferred transparently on chain to both scanners and community selected conservation projects, helping to create a virtuous cycle where our scientific collections support and incentivize the community making these valuable captures.
 
 
 
 This aims to create a new era for open academic research not limited by social, economical or geographic backgrounds while supporting local researchers and environmental habitats through regenerative economics powered by 3D-model NFT sales.
 
 
 
 Crucially, whilst this directly supports local researchers, we‚Äôre also protecting the planet and ensuring we‚Äôre recording nature in our fight against climate change and biodiversity loss.
 
 
 
 ## Why capture nature with scientific 3D plant specimens?
 
 
 
 Currently, scientific plant specimens are 2D pressings stored physically in herbariums, restricting access to specimens for both scientists and general enthusiasts outside of that location. And whilst the digitalisation of these scientific collections is underway globally, they still ultimately remain in their 2D form.
 
 
 
 Conversely, PlantGang‚Äôs community driven 3D scans improve upon traditional physical 2D dead plant specimens with additional details of morphology and colouration, capturing the plant as it would be in its natural environment. Additionally, since each specimen is collected with associated scientific metadata from its geolocation and collection date to phenology and associated species, all importantly stored on chain, giving each specimen an immutable scientific context grounding them in reality for use in research and education.
 
 
 
 ## The Future We Envision
 
 
 
 We hope to support a vision for a world where people can view and explore rare and inspiring digital specimens from across the globe, collected and uploaded by academic researchers, 3D-modellers and citizen scientists, whilst helping preserve IRL ecosystems and species through community funded research and conservation.
 
 
 
 In these environmentally challenging times, we face a pivotal moment. Our rich living ecosystems are threatened and suffering; we must find ways to proactively reduce climate change and live harmoniously with nature, documenting the world around us and utilising the digital to preserve the physical in an safe, environmentally-friendly and untamperable format.
 
 
 
 This effort is underpinned by the world-wide activation of citizen scientists and established researchers alike, brought together by a shared aim to support scientific research, education and conservation.
 
 
 
 ## Our Impact
 
 
 
 *We break barriers:*
 
 -In specimen collection, powering a 2D ‚Üí 3D digital revolution
 
 -In scientific engagement, driving science at all levels, available for all, from citizens to academics
 
 -We remove location and economic obstacles to education
 
 
 
 *We Immortalise:*
 
 -Decentralized preservation and future proofing of natural specimens and scientific data on chain
 
 -Recording ‚Äòmoments in time‚Äô in nature in vivid detail, allowing people to connect with this fleeting moment even after it has been and gone.
 
 
 
 *We Empower:*
 
 -Create a tradition of hyper-local conservation & research funding, giving power back to communities who understand their local environments and want to protect and live harmoniously with them
 
 -Community driven NFT creation and sales provide a self-funding mechanism that bypasses the need for institutional intermediaries, offering collectors ownership of real-world assets on chain whilst driving positive impact.

 # HOW IT ALL STARTED üå±
 
 Climate activists from various movements and initiatives (e.g., Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future, Scientists Rebellion) discovered shared challenges that hindered their progress. They questioned why they had to waste time and resources creating non-profits, bank accounts, and handling accounting, when they could focus on activism instead. This led to the creation of ""All for Climate,"" a non-profit that supports all movements and initiatives for climate justice.
 
 The organisation hosts over 200 independent collectives, 200 DAO's.
 
 
 
 **All for Climate aims to bring together diverse initiatives for climate justice, identify common issues, and address them collaboratively as a community.**
 
 
 
 Since December 2021, All for Climate partners with Gitcoin to create a cause round for climate, which has attracted over 150 projects and raised over $3M for climate-related causes.

 Why is this important? 
 
 
 
 Coffee is grown on nearly 10m ha in tropical regions worldwide, in the most biodiverse places in the world. Since the 1960s many farmers were forced to switch to full-sun monoculture production. It‚Äôs predicted, that by 2050 we will lose 50% of land suitable that is suitable for coffee cultivation.
 
 
 
 Regenerative agriculture is key to building resilient & high-yielding coffee systems. However, the methodology to transition existing coffee smallholder farms to thriving agroforestry systems doesn‚Äôt exist, as well there is no scalable and affordable way to monitor, report and verify the activities in the field.
 
 
 
 Famers are trapped in the highly centralized economy that forces them to optimize for volume. not for quality and doesn‚Äôt account for the environmental consequences of crop production. Thus, regeneration will only thrive in a decentralized market, where coffee is traded along with its environmental impact.

The WaterDAO has one live pilot project that it supported that is treating septic waste for reuse. A credit class and methodology are currently in their final stages of review with the Regen Network for water credit production. These credits will have significant co-benefits like carbon reductions and improved soil health.
 
 
 
 Work has begun towards creating an on chain monitoring system for water producers. As the DAO grows the goal is to continue to find more ways to add transparency to credits and automate the verification process on chain. 
 
 
 
 The purpose of the WaterDAO is to create transparency around sources of water, how they are generated, and establish a water credit classification system. We believe this can be done by creating a trustworthy and verifiable water credit that can be easily purchased and used to offset water usage. This would allow companies to continue to focus on their operational efficiencies while supporting the replacement of their water usage with equally efficient water producers.
 
 
 
 The purpose of the WaterDAO can be summed up through four main goals:
 
 
 
 1. Create a universally accepted water credit that is first supported by the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) community and eventually, by larger outside organizations. This credit class can serve as a building block for many types of water credits to be created.
 
 
 
 2. The WaterDAO will act as a support mechanism to verify credit quality. The DAO will oversee specific verification standards to provide a certain level of quality, standard for the credits issued through the DAO. 
 
 
 
 3. Incentivize companies to be ""Water Positive"" or at lease Water Neutral. This will come as the DAO expands and gains more influence. The DAO will make the process of becoming ""Water Positive"" a significantly easier process than it was previously, leaving companies fewer excuses to maintain their indifference. 
 
 
 
 4. Incentivize more environmentally friendly forms of desalination and other water treatments. This is done through a tiered credit system. For example, a water producer using desalination methods that require energy intensive methods and that has a potentially damaging runoff, would only qualify for second tier credits. To receive top tier credits, water producers must power their operations with cleaner and less energy intensive methods while mitigating harmful runoff. 
 
 
 
 RH2O water credits will be validated through the Regen Network. 
 
 
 
 If you are interested in joining our mission, please visit our website and join the Discord channel to get involved, we look forward to seeing you!
 
 
 
 A little bit more information if you have read this far:
 
 
 
 The WaterDAO will not only be validating water credits, but also actively working towards increasing the development of water treatment and credits by funding targeted areas that the DAO deems to be impactful. These areas will likely include:
 
 
 
 -Funding of specific tier 1 water treatment projects
 
 
 
 -Water technology development
 
 
 
 -Pilot projects leading to IP development
 
 
 
 -Sponsor water research and development
 
 
 
 -Acquisition of a specific water asset that can be licensed to water projects
 
 
 
 By funding water treatment projects, the WaterDAO is able to further develop the water credit space. The WaterDAO treasury will hold assets that are created or purchased by that DAO. These assets can be licensed out to water producers to help them provide higher tiered credits. The DAO will get to vote on the licensing agreements for specific projects as well as which ventures will receive funding. 
 
 
 
 Validating water credits:
 
 
 
 Each credit validated by the WaterDAO represents one cubic meter of additional treated water that is added back into the water system that is represented by the credit. Water generators who participate in the WaterDAO can mine water credits using Proof of Water (PoW). Once a water generating facility is certified to produce regenerative water (e.g. solar desalination), it will receive a blockchain-enabled IoT smart meter that communicates directly with the network through Proof of Water. PoW is a way to secure water by ensuring that every regenerative water credit (RH2O) is backed by a physical unit of water mined on the RH2O network. Water miners are rewarded with water credits by using Proof of Water to validate the generation of a unit of water and communicate the data associated with that unit of water through the IoT smart meter. In the future RH2O tokens will serve as water contracts where physical water can be collected. In addition, the physical mining of water ensures that the creation (supply) of water credits is limited by the capacity to generate physical water and the value of each RH2O token is a function of the balance between supply (miners) and demand (users).
 
 
 
 The WaterDAO will have specific credit classes based on the Regen Network that water producers must fall under in order to produce a specific credit. The first water credit will be for desalination projects and will generate RH2O (Regenerative Water Credit) tokens. Each Regenerative Water Credit measures one cubic meter of treated water that is added back to a specific water system. In other words, these credits are localized and set to the specific water system in which the water has been added. RH2O credits are only produced when water is verifiably added back into a water system.
 
 
 
 We will create three tiers of water credits based on the applications suitable for the quality of treated water. The credit tiers are based on a 100-point scale designed to promote the activities we deem to be the most advantageous for the health of the environment and to stimulate technological innovation.
 
 
 
 Those wishing to be funded through the DAO will be required to fill out an application form. Once completed, the DAO review committee will evaluate the results and assign values based on eight parameters.
 
 
 
 The results of the application will designate the project as one of the three water credit tiers based off of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the treated water.
 
 
 
 Potable Water Class: TDS less than 400 ppm and sterilized
 
 
 
 Agriculture Class: TDS less than 700 ppm and healthy for the environment.
 
 
 
 Industrial Class: Water of any TDS with a pre-approved buyer or application.

 # *The Uncomfortable truth*
 
 
 
 Most of the world‚Äôs liquid waste is dumped into our rivers, lakes and oceans untreated. Inefficient systems, lack of resources, and centralized environmental agencies all contribute to falling short of a solution people deserve.
 
 
 
 Two main reasons for the failure of current initiatives are; lack of transparency and misaligned incentives. Because data is opaque, it is: difficult to validate, hard to enforce results, and creates a lack of accountability. 
 
 
 
 
 
 # *Proposed Solution*
 
 Incentivize the monitoring of our most valuable resources using real-time data collected through multi-parameter IoT sensors, flow rate meters and more to create an immutable record of history, while calculating differences from incoming and outgoing readings to generate rewards. Oxygenchain is ready to power new economies with tangible results providing accountability, transparency and emphasizing efficiency to the public.
 
 
 
 By proving that their activities are not contaminating the planet, participants will receive a reward, which will encourage them to continue to operate in an environmentally friendly manner.
 
 
 
 # *How It Works*
 
 The rewards system incentivizes municipalities, industries, small companies and property owners to comply with environmental regulations and provides a clear way for them to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.

Industrial emitters continue to release greenhouse gases, a major contributor to climate change, while the public faces the consequences of climate disasters. Carbonlinked provides a solution: a unique token that brings the power to influence climate action into the hands of the public.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # Understanding Carbonlinked Tokens
 
 
 
 Each carbonlinked token corresponds to an emission unit, held by carbonlinked. For instance, the NZC token represents a New Zealand Emission unit within carbonlinked's account. By transforming these units into tradable tokens, carbonlinked offers the public:
 
 
 
 * **The Power to Influence:** Purchasing and holding these tokens can directly affect emission prices. As these tokens become scarce, industries face higher costs to release new emissions. This makes investment to decarbonize their products more attractive.
 
 
 
 * **Investment Opportunity:** With the decreasing availability of emission units through cap-and-trade programs, these tokens are positioned to become valuable assets.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # The Cap-and-Trade System Explained
 
 
 
 Governments employ cap-and-trade programs to encourage industries to reduce emissions.
 
 
 
 These systems work by:
 
 
 
 1. Setting a maximum limit on emissions.
 
 2. Issuing tradable emission units, whose prices are market-driven.
 
 3. Gradually reducing the number of available units.
 
 4. Enforcing strict regulations to ensure compliance.
 
 
 
 The price of these emission units is critical. The more expensive they become; the more companies are motivated to reduce their footprint.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # The Challenge: Public Participation
 
 
 
 Currently, the public faces barriers in purchasing emission units due to:
 
 
 
 * Complex administrative processes.
 
 * High minimum purchase requirements.
 
 * Steep fees.
 
 
 
 This keeps the public out of the emission market, resulting in a distorted price that does not represent the true cost of climate harm.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # Carbonlinked's Solution
 
 
 
 Carbonlinked issues tokens, backed 1:1 by emission units. Here's a simple walkthrough using the NZC token:
 
 1. Emission units (NZUs) are deposited to Carbonlinked.
 
 2. Carbonlinked mints equivalent NZC tokens.
 
 3. These tokens are sent to the depositor, after fees.
 
 4. Users can then trade these tokens or redeem them for emission units.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # Maintaining Token Value
 
 
 
 Should the token's value drift from its emission unit counterpart, an arbitrage opportunity emerges where someone can profit from buying one and selling the other. This mechanism keeps the token price in check with the emission unit.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # The Real Benefits
 
 
 
 * **Combatting Emissions:** Holding Carbonlinked tokens effectively curbs the emission unit supply. This makes it more expensive for businesses to release new emissions.
 
 * **Scarcity-driven Asset:** Emission units are set to become scarcer over time. Token holders can benefit by trading them or redeeming the underlying units.
 
 * **Betting on Tomorrow:** With many governments lagging in climate targets, a reduction in emission units (the cap) is expected, making these tokens even more valuable in the future.
 
 
 
 ---
 
 
 
 # Why Blockchain?
 
 
 
 * **Accessibility:** With internet access and a wallet, anyone can participate.
 
 * **Digital Ledger Security:** Secured by the Ethereum network, users have complete control of their assets.
 
 * **Transparency:** All transactions and holdings are visible on the blockchain.
 
 * **Limitless Integration:** Tokenized units can be integrated into various smart contracts, from loans to insurance. The possibilities are endless.
 
 * **Fractional Ownership:** Tokens can be divided, accommodating all investor levels.

 # Costs and Security
 
 
 
 Carbonlinked charges fees only during the token issuance or redemption. The entire minting and burning process is overseen through a secure multisignature wallet managed by Carbonlinked directors. The token contract is upgradable for future adaptability."

 At Shamba we build solutions to monitor and verify ecological impact and make the carbon market accessible to smallholders (people with small pieces of land).
 
 
 
 Our goal is to mobilize millions of smallholders in the Global South into climate action by making it possible for them to get rewarded for regeneration projects.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## The tools we build
 
 
 
 We build solutions that leverage satellite data, ground truthing data, machine learning, and AI to monitor and verify ecological impact.
 
 
 
 We also build tools that connect to this DMRV backend and enable smallholders to create carbon credits through small projects.
 
 
 
 The solutions we are building not only drive accessibility of the voluntary carbon market but also unlock new climate innovations.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Updates since the last round
 
 
 
 1. We have been working on building AI-based tools for verification. This mainly includes developing machine learning algorithms to identify and count individual trees from high-resolution satellite data. This work is ongoing and we are still building, testing, and iterating on these tools.
 
 
 
 1. We have onboarded over 100 farmer groups to our ReFi platform and currently have over 3000 individual small farmers onboarded.
 
 
 
 1. We have mapped over 2000 acres of smallholder farms in Kenya and are working on baseline data for these areas.
 
 
 
 1. We have also scaled ReFi awareness and capacity-building meetings to cover a large expanse of central Kenya. Our efforts in this regard have reached thousands of farmers across Kenya and are ongoing in order to reach many more.
 
 
 
 1. We are in the advanced stages of planning the second ReFi Kenya event which will bring together stakeholders in ReFi from across the country.
 
 
 
 ## Tree planting in Kenya
 
 
 
 New carbon projects have been launched in collaboration with the smallholder farmers we have onboarded. Currently, over 50,000 trees have been planted through this partnership and we plan to plant more during the upcoming rainy season in October.
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Current focus
 
 
 
 We continue to work on our AI-based tools for the automated monitoring of carbon stocks from satellite data.
 
 
 
 We are also onboarding farmer groups and organizations that have been engaged in carbon projects in Kenya over the last couple of years. We are helping these groups and the NGOs they work with to quantify and register their carbon credits and bring them to market."

 Permet is building the first transparent, open-source, community-owned toolkit for the fashion creator economy.
 
 
 
 We want to return power + ownership to creators and producers - and eliminate negative human rights and environmental externalities from the fashion supply chain.
 
 
 
 # **How does Permet fit Gitcoin Grants criteria?**
 
 
 
 - Permet is building a regenerative garment production system that breaks the ""create to sell"" garment production cycle - which currently drives the garment industry and creates massive waste in the process.
 
 - We are developing models for traceable garment production ‚Äî which make metadata on the resources and labor behind garment collections accessible and transparent.
 
 - We are also creating new incentive models and technological rails that allow for the creation of value outside of the actual physical production of clothes (and the resulting waste that comes from that process.
 
 - Currently working on an OSS regenerative merch production tool that leverages trustless, onchain data + smart contracts ‚Äî an environment and ethical-labor friendly alternative to current destructive merch production systems.
 
 - Soft-launched a research publication open-sourcing the process behind building Permet‚Äôs OSS tooling + physical supply chain ‚Äî focused on educating young creatives on the use cases of blockchain technology. Can be viewed at **[permet.co/research](http://permet.co/research)**.
 
 - Launched Visual Maintenance System e-zine advocating for and building community around sustainable fashion ‚Äî has been adopted by prominent artists like figure31, shl0ms, and terra0.
 
 - Permet is also working on the first open-source community-based supply chain. We have created an MVP supply chain in Toronto, CA and are producing the first garment sample prototypes with this supply chain.
 
 
 
 # **What progress has been made since alpha round?**
 
 
 
 - Permet (fka HibiscusDAO) has been part of past Gitcoin Climate + DEI + OSS rounds.
 
 - Our goal is to onboard new demographics into the blockchain ecosystem by creating new use cases on the application layer ‚Äî especially for people of color and other traditionally overlooked demographics (who are the next generation of creatives and the next billion ETH users).
 
 - Since the last grant round that Permet participated in (alpha round) ‚Äî distributed just under $25K to supply chain / participants, proving out a prototype model for alternative incentives in garment production.
 
 - We‚Äôve also built an MVP supply chain of micro-factories and at-home producers in Toronto and have started producing samples of our first garments produced with this open-source supply chain.
 
 - We also created a research publication to open-source the core ideas/philosophy behind the work we are doing ‚Äî with the goal of creating a community of the next generation of garment producers ‚Äî and a garden of complementary initiatives and products that work in tandem / synthesis to Permet.
 
 - In the continuing spirit Virgil Abloh‚Äôs ‚ÄúFree Game‚Äù ‚Äî we are open sourcing the principles and ideas behind leveraging blockchain technology as a way to give the people in the garment production supply chain (who actually need it) access to the life-changing use cases blockchains and OSS can enable.

 # **WHY?**
 
 
 
 ## **Current Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation**
 
 
 
 The apparel and luxury market is growing exponentially: reaching $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.
 
 
 
 But the industry's success is rooted in exploitation. Its business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders.
 
 
 
 ### **Traditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation**
 
 
 
 Slave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands.
 
 
 
 These human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR.
 
 
 
 ### **Traditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation**
 
 
 
 Talented young designers generate massive value for brands - often with little to no compensation.
 
 
 
 A successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand.
 
 
 
 ### **Traditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation**
 
 
 
 Fashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit.
 
 
 
 When overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.
 
 
 
 # **We‚Äôre a black-led team and here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre working on:**
 
 
 
 ## **Enabling Profit Redistribution + Transparent Supply Chain + Community Ownership = Human Rights Impact**
 
 
 
 Permet recently created the first ever on-chain profit redistribution contract for garment production - redistributing profits from FWB merch sales to supply chain participants.
 
 
 
 Permet is looking to build on this by onboarding sewers, pattern makers, printers & other workers from the garment industry who are ""stuck"" working for a factory with no access to profit redistribution - giving them ownership over the value they create.
 
 
 
 Building cryptographic profit sharing into our tooling enables the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel.
 
 
 
 Crypto technologies help share ownership with stakeholders:
 
 
 
 - Community owned ateliers vs. factories and manufacturers.
 
 - Fork-able concepts and tools can be validated and iterated on by community creators.
 
 - Designs registered as on-chain vectors - enabling proper credit and compensation.
 
 - Future royalties of products can be distributed back to creators and the community.
 
 - Locally accessible physical design and fashion resources.
 
 
 
 ## **Building a Transparent Supply Chain**
 
 
 
 Creating open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.
 
 
 
 ## **Creating ‚ÄúProof of Ethical Production‚Äù + Oracles**
 
 
 
 Eventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.
 
 
 
 ## **Fighting Fast Fashion = Environmental Impact**
 
 
 
 As a part of our stack - we are working on the first solution for holding fast-fashion polluters accountable.
 
 
 
 Now we want to enable supply chain provenance and environmental transparency in the garment production process: create and test the first functional model for an open-source apparel supply chain to show how the garments were produced and the corresponding environmental impacts.
 
 
 
 ## **Supply Chain Accountability**
 
 
 
 What does this look like in practice?
 
 
 
 Now that we‚Äôve experimented with profit redistribution - we want to run experiments to figure out how to capture garment production metadata on chain.
 
 
 
 And after that - putting these new data capture + manufacturing processes into practice by experimenting with a garment collection that incorporates provenance and accountability around environmental impacts of the collection.
 
 
 
 We hope that our efforts will set precedent and can serve as a model for future apparel projects. The current landscape of crypto fashion is ‚Äúmerch‚Äù that encourages wasteful consumption, enablement of existing exploitative power structures, and no regard for the environmental impacts.
 
 
 
 Permet seeks to change that by providing an alternative approach that enables sustainability which already reduces waste or gives accountability around environmental impacts of garment production.
 
 
 
 ## **Open-Sourcing a Model for Ethical Clothing Production**
 
 
 
 This experiment will inform the development of environmental oracles that will allow any apparel project to open-source their environmental impact and adopt new environmental standards - all done via leveraging supply chain metadata arising through the garment production process.
 
 
 
 This supply chain experiment will be done with local supply chain participants in Toronto, Canada - with the hope of subsequently expanding out into other countries.
 
 
 
 Permet is creating and open sourcing the first model for a decentralized, transparent supply chain in fashion.
 
 
 
 ## **How = Utilizing L2s for Real-World Crypto Use Cases**
 
 
 
 Blockchain technology is often criticized by naysayers as not having real-world uses.
 
 
 
 Permet‚Äôs goal of creating an open-source, community-owned supply chain is one of the strongest examples of an IRL use case for crypto.
 
 
 
 In order to create a truly sustainable, community-owned supply chain for clothing, Permet needs to focus heavily on grassroots community work - onboarding sewers, pattern makers, textile producers, and other supply chain participants.
 
 
 
 In many cases - these supply chain participants are members of underrepresented groups: people of color without much exposure to technology - who would be vulnerable to exploitation by traditional fashion industry structures and institutions.
 
 
 
 These participants in the garment supply chain have never heard of blockchain before.
 
 
 
 Onboarding them onto Ethereum mainnet - and having them pay anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars in gas fees - is simply not feasible for this demographic.
 
 
 
 Instead we will work directly with these local supply chain participants to onboard them into crypto via L2s - which can provide an accessible, feasible entry point to these new ecosystem participants.
 
 
 
 We hope to use L2 infrastructure as foundational substrates to build real world utility and onboard new non-crypto native users.
 
 
 
 We will open-source this process to create onboarding resources and serve as a model to other projects who are building real world use cases on L2s - to help accelerate driving real-world adoption.
 
 
 
 ## **What‚Äôs next on the roadmap?**
 
 
 
 We‚Äôve hit our short term goal to use liquid 0xSplits to experiment with redistribution contracts for primary sales for garment workers since the last Gitcoin grants round.
 
 
 
 We seek to build on this success by creating garments made using a transparent supply chain by open sourcing garment production metadata - proving out our model for supply chain accountability.
 
 
 
 Through this process - we will onboard underrepresented communities onto Ethereum L2.
 
 
 
 As mentioned above - we‚Äôre working towards a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically, without negative human rights and environmental externalities.
 
 
 
 With an improved model we can build better to do more, produce less, and return value to creators and users.

 Our founding team has combined more than a decade of experience in web3 native product development and the renewable energy industry- having previously built & commissioned into commercial production a photovoltaic portfolio exceeding ‚Ç¨200M with further large scale wind & green hydrogen constructions underway.
 
 
 
 To date, Gigawatt has received $50k in grant funding from Prezenti.xyz and remains fully boostrapped.
 
 
 
 Ultimately, the Gigawatt protocol will evolve into the world‚Äôs first decentralized energy commons. Experienced protocol actors will apply to governance to utilise protocol revenue (generated from performance & withdrawal fees) and diversified pool principal liquidity to engage in attractive asset M&A opportunities, meaning that the protocol will own & manage profitable renewable energy sources around the world. 
 
 
 
 The compound effect of acquiring 10s-100s of globally distributed renewable energy sources will enable Gigawatt to offer a market leading, dividend-esque yield to its token holders. 
 
 
 
 On a longer time horizon the industry expert Gigawatt community, represented by the founding team & token collective, might also opt to fund & manage their own renewable energy source construction projects which typically have an order of magnitude larger IRR than M&A ops alone. However, the protocol should first achieve escape velocity in terms of revenue generated by acquisitions in order to better manage the heightened risk of those efforts."

 We launched a limited pilot last year, thanks in part to gitcoin, and installed over 110 instances of natural infrastructure in dryland streams, on 6 different watersheds with differing geological features. Then it dumped rain - a few washed out, we've learned lessons but generally very pleased. 
 
 
 
 Our objectives are to grow this bioregional pilots portfolio, help cultivate a bioregional learning center and crowdfund and curate foundational funding support. Our leadership is a student of the Design School to Regenerate Earth, and we're using the Bloom Network (see https://bloomnetwork.earth/texaspanhandle). 
 
 
 
 We have sufficient funding for the landscape rehydration work next winter, on these and different watersheds - some publicly accessible (a huge value add). But we lack funding for the technological work that is needed, that we're uniquely qualified to help build. 
 
 
 
 We have an ecocredit concept and intentions to build the same using Regen's permissionless ecocredit module.

  ## WTF is web3beach? 
 
 üèùÔ∏è
 
 Web3beach is a project focused on onboarding marginalized, unbanked, and disenfranchised communities to the world of web3. Our aim is to empower these communities (with crypto) through participation in social and environmental impact activities, such as beach cleanups, educational tutoring for youth, art classes, and other recreational initiatives. We firmly believe that these communities have the most to gain from crypto and are also the most willing to take action to regenerate their communities.

 At the innovative pop-up city, Zuzalu, founded by tech visionary Vitalik Buterin, two passionate advocates for nature's rights, Jasmine and Marijana, found their paths converging. They connected over a shared vision: how could technology be harnessed to advocate for nature's rights, especially the preservation of Europe's last wild rivers?
 
 
 
 As serendipity would have it, at that same gathering in Zuzalu, they met Danilo. A trailblazer in sensor technology, he had been tirelessly working on refining real-time data sensors. Recognizing the potential for synergy, the trio teamed up. With Danilo's expertise and a strategic partnership with Retune, they birthed an advanced beta version of SENTIENT's AI-chat. This chat could not only interact but also process live river data, providing an intimate, immediate connection to these precious ecosystems.
 
 
 
 With the blueprint in hand and a technology capable of actualizing their vision, Jasmine, Marijana, embarked on a mission to the Balkans. Engaging with a gathering of almost hundred international scientists and activists on the ground, they delved deep into understanding the nuances of river ecosystems and how SENTIENT could serve as a beacon for activists, researchers, and nature lovers alike.
 
 
 
 Their journey, initiated by a fortuitous meeting at Zuzalu, now seeks to create ripples of change not just for the rivers of Europe but for threatened waterways worldwide.

 We are seeking funding through this Gitcoin grant to establish a Regenerative Finance local node in Tanzania. Our project focuses on creating a waste regeneration system that integrates blockchain technology to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable finance practices with waste pickers at the heart of it all. We invite you to support our initiative to make a positive impact on both the environment and local communities.
 
 
 
 Introduction:
 
 Our project aims to establish a Regenerative Finance local node in Tanzania, with a focus on waste regeneration and blockchain integration. By combining innovative waste management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.
 
 
 
 Problem Statement:
 
 Tanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.
 
 
 
 Project Solution:
 
 Our project's core solution involves the establishment of a waste regeneration system that transforms waste materials into valuable resources. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial rewards to participants who contribute to the system.
 
 
 
 Project Goals:
 
 - Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management.
 
 - Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants.
 
 - Community Engagement: Raise awareness about waste-related issues and involve local communities in waste management and regeneration efforts as well as how they can benefit from sustainable practices in the form of carbon credits, tokenizing of Real world Assets and much more.
 
 
 
 
 
 We are looking to revive the machinery at our incubated site to increase capacity and production of these eco-products such as eco-spare parts for Rickcshaws, eco-tiles and eco-bricks which will help add additionality to our project to enable it to receive quality carbon credits which will eventually raise the basic income of our waste pickers from a mere 0.1$ per kilogram of plastic waste.
 
 
 
 Examples of our eco products include eco-spare parts for Rickshaws, eco-tiles and eco-bricks which are massively needed to support local Tanzanians and their small businesses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Team:
 
 
 
 Our team consists of dedicated individuals with diverse expertise:
 
 - David Machuche from Chatafisha, Project Lead: A professional with deep knowledge of local ecological challenges, Regenerative Finance, financial inclusion and Web3 for real world use cases. 
 
 - Victor Muhagachi from Chatafisha, Strategy and Web3 for local communities: An experienced strategy designer, blockchain developer specializing in onboarding local communities to Web3 in broken down Swahili terminologies.
 
 - Eng. Allen from Zaidi Recyclers Kimambo, Environmental Scientist: A waste management expert with over 10 years experience and a background in sustainable development.
 
 - Teresia Mhaiki Community Outreach Coordinator: A communication specialist focusing on community engagement, specifically in environment and sustainability.
 
 
 
 Budget:
 
 - Technology Development: $10,000 for decentralized app that will contain sub wallets for waste pickers, track credit scores with blockchain integration.
 
 - Infrastructure & Plant: $20,000 for setting up waste regeneration facilities and community engagement centers.
 
 - Logistics for waste: $2,000 for reallocating the waste from collection points to recyclers.
 
 - Awareness Campaign & Events: $2,000 for educational workshops, awareness programs, and community training.

 # Update #
 
 
 
 Since the conclusion of the Gitcoin Beta Round, The Solar Foundation has focused on the following key areas:
 
 
 
 1. Developing a community solar plus universal basic income (UBI) project in collaboration with [Ayowecca Uganda,](https://ayoweccauganda.org/) and [GoodDollar](https://www.gooddollar.org/). The pilot project will empower 50 women in Tororo, Uganda, by providing them with mobile phones, digital funds for mobile minutes and a small solar electric system. This project seeks to bridge the gender digital divide, increase access to clean energy and enhance resilience in the face of climate change. We plan to deploy this pilot project before the end of the year.
 
 
 
 2. Researching and funding an off-grid solar energy system to power the office operations for our partner, [Ayowecca Uganda,](https://ayoweccauganda.org/) a community led agroforestry NGO ‚Äî replacing an unreliable diesel generator and its GHG emissions as well as decreasing the need to purchase fossil fuel. We chose a solution that can be easily moved to a new location in the future as Ayowecca currently rents their office space. 
 
 
 
 [![Ayowecca-Solar-Office.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nLtkBwyP/Ayowecca-Solar-Office.png)](https://postimg.cc/fVBmh5Tc)
 
 
 
 3. Working with [OMAWA](https://omawatanzania.org/) in Tanzania to develop a solar microgrid and retroactive funding pilot to power the Iring‚Äôong‚Äôweni Primary School in Mataleto. The microgrid will provide electricity for classrooms, staff houses and security lights. This primary school enrolls approximately 800 students and faces significant electricity challenges with no integration of computers and technology in the delivery of its curriculum. The microgrid will power OMAWA‚Äôs mission to support the needs and rights of vulnerable children.
 
 
 
 4. Partnering with [Switch,](https://www.whynotswitch.com/) a fellow Gitcoin Grantee based in Nigeria, who is developing hardware and software solutions for monitoring solar energy in a transparent and decentralized way. We will be working to incorporate their monitoring device on several of our projects. This will allow us to monitor the energy production of the systems. We plan to incorporate this on-chain stream of data into our impact certificate pilot as a proof of the solar project impact. 
 
 
 
 
 
 # Problem #
 
 
 
 Electricity is an essential public good that drives economic growth, improves living standards, and alleviates poverty. The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #7 seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; yet according to IEA‚Äôs [World Energy Outlook 2022 Report,](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2022) there will still be 660 million people without access to electricity in 2030, 85% of those living in sub-Saharan Africa. 
 
 Stand-alone solar systems and micro/mini grids have high up-front costs that present affordability barriers to accessing clean energy for people in low-income countries and rural communities. People without access to affordable, clean energy use polluting and unhealthy sources such as diesel and kerosene for cooking, heating, transport and lighting. In addition, energy poverty results in a lack of consistent access to information, communications and technology and has serious economic and social consequences.
 
 On the African continent today, over 600 million people lack access to electricity, according to the [International Energy Association](https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings). At The Solar Foundation, we prioritize solar solutions for rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa where over 80% of the people without electricity live. We can and must address the fact that African countries face more severe effects from climate change than almost any other region of the world, despite being the least responsible for the CO2 emissions that cause the climate crisis.

 > The Solar Foundation‚Äôs installation of solar power at Helpers Foundation Nursery and Primary School has given the school 24 hours of uninterrupted power supply, wherein students now learn at a faster pace unlike before. This donation has given the teachers a massive moral boost in teaching as well as enabling the environment to do their job. They can now charge their phones and also teach the students digital skills as well as basic computer training. ‚Äî Chidi Okeke, director, Helpers Social Development Foundation: 
 
 [How the Solar System is Empowering the Education System in Nigeria.](https://www.helpersfoundation.org/how-the-solar-system-is-empowering-education-system-in-nigeria/)
 
 To effectively address the climate crisis, we must achieve universal access to clean electricity; we believe a decentralized approach will be required to solve this problem. Instead of large, centralized entities burning coal and other fossil fuels, The Solar Foundation focuses on localized, small solar microgrids and individual systems. These off-grid solar solutions can supply power to small communities as close to the end-user as possible, helping to ensure that no one is left behind in the renewables revolution, especially people traditionally underserved in terms of access to electricity and financial services. 
 
 All African countries receive plentiful sunlight, and in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, mini grids and standalone solar systems are considered the most viable solutions for accessing reliable and affordable electricity. Also, solar and battery costs have decreased 80% since 2012, and an analysis by [RMI](https://rmi.org/insight/x-change-electricity/) forecasts that the cost of solar, already the cheapest source of energy in history, will decrease 50% by the end of this decade. In the same way some developing countries and communities leapfrogged over landlines and went straight to mobile phones, communities in sub-Saharan Africa have the potential to leapfrog over centralized dirty power grids and adopt decentralized solar solutions instead.

 Through our work with local, grassroots partners in Uganda, Nigeria and Puerto Rico, we‚Äôve witnessed how small solar energy solutions can unlock exponential benefits especially for those in rural communities beyond the reach of the grid. The Solar Foundation has completed projects with [Ayowecca Uganda,](https://ayoweccauganda.org/) [Helpers Social Development Foundation,](https://www.helpersfoundation.org/) and [Footprint Project](https://www.footprintproject.org/) which utilize off-grid solar solutions to decrease CO2e from polluting diesel generators and kerosene lanterns, while empowering economic, social, and educational benefits. 
 
 Off-grid solar solutions increase climate adaptation and resilience, providing power to unlock access to information, communications and technology as well as for energy efficient appliances such as fans and small refrigerators. Increased access to reliable clean energy also provides tangible health benefits including a significant reduction in household air pollution by removing kerosene lamps from households, reducing health issues and accidents. 
 
 # New Open-Source Models #
 
 Business as usual is not sufficient to address interconnected global challenges such as the climate crisis, gender inequity and financial exclusion. At The Solar Foundation, we aim to reinvent the non-profit and NGO model using the tools of web3 and the power of DeFi to create open-source, novel funding mechanisms. Our foundation provides tax efficiency to donors and funds solar projects worldwide. Our vision is for ownership, payments and system monitoring to all be on the blockchain for improved transparency, accountability and proven impact. 
 
 A collaborative approach is essential to our mission; we seek to form a strong coalition of web3 and ReFi projects, and bring the voices of the communities we serve into the conversation. We continually seek to coordinate with diverse partners who share our desire to accelerate universal access to clean energy and provide an ownership stake in the solar deployed. The Solar Foundation also works with local installers to install the solar systems and support local economies. In addition, we will continue to support our projects long term, and we commit to learning and sharing best practices through monitoring and ongoing communications.

 dMeter is unique in the dMRV space, in that we're not designing a product, hardware or software stack, but facilitating the development of a robust, diverse, distributed decentralized MRV ecosystem that offers options to land users, project developers & community/citizen scientists. Its' about public accountability and necessary to accomplish any kind of effective, comprehensive payment for ecosystem services marketplace, or for natural capital accounting purposes, or to hold polluters to account. 
 
 
 
 We require fundraising to grow this community, organize the associations network, launch quarterly dMRV newsletter and demonstrate leadership in the ReFi space, and in re all kinds of RWA claims (crypto acronym for Real World Assets). 
 
 
 
 Now for the substantive discussion, context & principles. 
 
 
 
 A. MRV (monitoring, reporting, and verification) overview
 
 MRV consists of three distinct features, all of which are vital to conveying legitimacy of regenerative projects (such as tree planting) to stakeholders. Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. Measurements may be collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys that empower experts & citizen scientists. Reporting involves describing i) measured data, ii) the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, and iii) potential biases as well as assumptions that went into the data collection/analysis. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that is utilized to ensure the confidence in the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.
 
 Decentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system. For current accreditation standards a combination of on the ground data collection, satellite sensing and IOT devices are used to back the credits. Utilizing web3 mentality, trust minimized data collection methods can be created. An example of this is to write open codes for actions that used to be performed by humans, like detecting a tree and the species of tree it is. Other data collection technologies can become integrated into this system as they become standard in the future.
 
 Once the data is collected, open source reporting and verification methodologies can be utilized to analyze the data. Entities that collect the data and create the analysis methodologies are paid each time data is used and an analysis done. This inspires entrepreneurs to build specialized dMRV services which can benefit further regenerative projects. The entire dMRV allows for standardization, trustlessness, immutability, transparency, and open accessibility. This paves the way for decentralized data backed credits. These credits are tied to a specific regenerative action and entity who carried out the action continuously updated over time as more data is gathered. This data and the methodologies used to analyze it is stored permanently and immutably. The collectors of this data are the owners of it, allowing for sensitive data to be fully controlled by its owner. The dMRV would assist regenerative projects across blockchains and be interoperable with any new blockchain that came into existence. Every entity that is involved with this dMRV helps to iteratively improve upon it. With this, local communities can become more deeply involved with how the regenerative projects they carry out go through the dMRV process as well as tap into funding that was not previously available to carry out these projects. Along with that the diversity and veracity of Natural Capital assets being valued can exponentially increase.
 
 Monitoring
 
 In this dMRV everything is open to where there is only one final layer of trust- the data itself. Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). The data collected is stored permanently and immutably through current technology such as Filecoin Green. By multiple data sources backing up that a regenerative action has occurred, more accurate calculations can be created. When one of those inputs is inaccurate, the other data sources can openly show a dispute. When a dispute arises, the stakeholders of the dMRV system can confirm or deny the accuracy of the data. Scoring this data for quality, resolution, and temporal frequency can enable any entity utilizing the dMRV to compare the data sources they pay for. Allowing them to quickly choose the best dataset for their needs. Through this, data becomes highly available as many organizations strive to provide the best data for people‚Äôs needs. This puts publishers on a level playing field and allows the companies with the best data to naturally succeed. Along with that publishers can not only benefit from the dMRV utilizing the data but other organizations that might want their data (such as parametric insurance). When individuals can decide who gets access to their data, they can ensure it is used ethically. They can also willingly give access to their data to those attempting to create good causes.
 
 Reporting and Verification
 
 Reporting and verification utilize algorithms. Algorithms are a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task (types of algorithms include standard, machine learning and AI). They are used to process data or information. For example georeferenced imagery can be analyzed using an algorithm that detects if a tree is present in that imagery. Another example is an algorithm can choose which data sources are the most appropriate for evaluating a regenerative action based upon how these data sources did previously. This is more efficient than a human could do, reducing the dMRV costs.
 
 Previous MRV organizations have developed their own algorithms. Some of these algorithms are open source and will become part of the dMRV system if there is no conflict with the creators in doing so. Oftentimes it is only the MRV organization that developed the algorithm that uses it. Allowing more entities to utilize the MRV algorithm, ‚Äúalgorithms-as-a-service‚Äù (AaaS) have arisen as a business model. AaaS allows entities of very small to large financial backing to benefit from them. For example, a small business might not have the resources to hire a data scientist to build and train a machine learning model or maintain the infrastructure needed to store the data that the model would be trained on. However, with AaaS, they can simply subscribe to a service and use the algorithms that have been created by someone else. Now through decentralization, algorithm providers can offer their services in a trust minimized and automated way. Along with that they can help financially support the providers of the data that was used to train that algorithm, which in turn gives data providers an incentive to provide high-quality and unique data that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be available for training. Algorithmic transparency allows regenerative actions to demonstrate the ecosystem services they provide in a trustless, decentralized and immutable manner. Which in turn will attract more ReFi investors to support these actions. The more funding that gets channeled towards regenerative actions, the more the dMRV system is used and with each iteration it improves.
 
 Infrastructure
 
 In order to host the data and distribute money to creators of algorithms, among other components of the dMRV system, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. To permanently store the data collected, decentralized storage systems need to be utilized. For distributing that data to entities that would like to purchase it, data markets need to adequately display it. A new distributed system needs to be created for analyzing that data and paying for each time an analysis methodology is utilized. Some of these systems exist, however they can be improved upon to further support the dMRV system.
 
 Domain Experts
 
 For each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system.
 
 As these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury.
 
 Revenue Sources
 
 This dMRV system will be created bottom up from individuals and software, these individuals are who we aim to get rewarded through this software system. The flow of this system is planned to be as follows. An entity pays for collection of data, entities affiliated with this dMRV system collect the data using techniques that are part of this system. The data goes to decentralized storage which is paid for, then the entity that pays for the data is able to access it. The data is interpreted via methodologies either that the entity has proprietary control over or that is open source and part of the dMRV system. If the method is open source, a donation is channeled to the creators of the method for its use. The collected data is also marketed in a data marketplace, when people use the data they pay for the use of it. This payment goes towards both the marketplace and the data creator.
 
 Some of the business cases for dMRV are
 
 dMRV setup as a service
 
 Restoration project strategy for insurers
 
 Ecosystem risk area assessment, regeneration plan, and MRV for insurers, municipalities, and eco-tourism enterprises
 
 Environmental Asset Creation- Carbon Credits
 
 Here are some empathy maps showcasing what each business case may be thinking- https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP9wfNe8=/
 
 Cross Organizational Support
 
 Behind all of this are people. These people have formed their own decentralized organizations specializing in different aspects of the dMRV system. There are organizations specializing in data collection, analysis and domain experts. The organizations participating in the dMRV will continue to expand as the system builds continued support.

 B. dMeter organizational structure
 
 The Principles that dMeter Operates By Is:
 
 Legitimacy
 
 We build with integrity, with high standards for quality of data and mindfulness with how it‚Äôs collected. We build legitimacy with the communities, stakeholders, and internal contributors involved by striving for alignment of our highest intentions with the day-to-day working processes that move our work forward.
 
 Transparency of Process
 
 When facilitating data collection, making decisions, or building tools, we provide clear documentation of how it was done, enabling people to understand what went into a specific action, decision, or strategy. In this process we aim to be as holistic as possible.
 
 Collaborative interoperability
 
 Data infrastructure needs to be highly interoperable so individuals can take their data with them and use it in different ecosystems, technologies, and use-cases. We create space for collaboration between organizations and focus on the standards that enable interoperability for ecodata.
 
 Distributed & decentralized
 
 We distribute and decentralize power. There is no top-down hierarchy in dMeter where you answer to a boss. We self-organize around our strategy and allow leadership to organically arise from the recognition of valuable contributions by the community. We hold ourselves accountable to dMeter as a community and dMRV as a movement, not any individual. Along with that we empower systems that enable anyone anywhere to collect and provide data to the system in a trust minimized way.
 
 Clear Responsibility & Accountability
 
 We take initiative to define our responsibilities given our role and desires in dMeter, and hold ourselves accountable to these responsibilities on a day-to-day basis. We support each other to take responsibility and accountability by doing it in our own workflow and communications.

0xd1cf66794caca737618758142c61ea97f0c11d5643308b160bba1296cf9638fd,Project ‚ÄúEco-Giving Accountability‚Äù: Building Bridges Between Communities and Socially Conscious Donors,"This project is essentially a ‚Äúfact checker‚Äù that places frontline communities directly at the ""giving table"" in the role of directing funding efficiently. They can then build capacity, implement effective climate resilience strategies, and respond to climate-related risks more robustly. We know from our research and the contributions of others that 1) divested communities are often the target populations for climate and social justice giving; 2) yet these promises are often not kept or diverted out of these communities; 3) there is no consistent way to track these fund; and 4) the communities rarely have any meaningful input in these processes. We want to create a solution. 
 
 
 
 Deliverable:
 
 The tool facilitates partnerships between frontline communities and businesses, intergovernmental organizations, and international funders. By bridging the gap between these stakeholders via tracking, data aggregation, and direct feedback, we will inject accountability and transparency into an opaque ecosystem. The outcome should be more efficiency, enhanced access to these resources for the targeted communities, and better collaboration.
 
 
 
 
 
 The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù: 
 
 There is no transparency in environmental and social justice giving, nor is there a feedback loop between donors and targeted communities. Transparency is diluted to nonexistent because of multiple subcontractors and middlemen controlling narratives about communities and funding. The end result is an opaque giving environment in which outcomes are unknown until you see media stories like this one, https://tinyurl.com/4r8rzn7a."

 # Bundle Description
 
 
 
 üåç Introducing the Impact Verification Infrastructure Bundle - the ultimate toolkit for proving impact and unlocking funding in the sustainability and climate solutions space. This bundle brings together 5 cutting-edge projects üî• that are changing the game for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) impact. With our bundle, you'll be able to confidently prove that your projects are delivering real, tangible results.üí°
 
 
 
 ### What
 
 
 
 We recently heard a story about a businessman who decided to sell one of his father‚Äôs petrol pumps to buy forest land. He claimed that carbon sequestration was a ‚Äúlazyboy‚Äù way to make money with little effort. He bought 100 hectares of deciduous forest land in Northern Russia and planted fast-growing birch trees, which are not indigenous to the area. To make way for the new trees, he cut down rich biodiversity, leading to the destruction of the local ecosystem. The situation was worsened by the use of fertilizers and short-term solutions, which caused soil erosion, over-extraction of the water table, and displacement of local species. This is not what regeneration should look like.
 
 
 
 ### Why
 
 
 
 This anecdote is not an isolated incident, but a growing concern due to the inadequacy of impact accounting. The worst part is how well meaning activists, investors and regulators cant help but incentivize actions like the one outlined above. As the Impact Verification Bundle, we believe that better, more holistic impact verification metrics are key to addressing these problems. All our regenerative efforts are underpinned by the quality of our measurement and verification tools that enable us to track the real impact we've made.
 
 
 
 Although tons of carbon sequestered can serve as a baseline for measuring regenerative impact, it doesn't provide the whole picture. In fact, it could even encourage actions that destroy biodiversity in the region where it is being applied. This is known as the measurement problem, as Goodhart's law states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. The measurement problem is also the main barrier when it comes to funding other domains of regenerative action like litter cleanup, water & soil health, and even hard to quantify domains like psychological well-being.
 
 
 
 ### How
 
 
 
 To solve this problem, we need decentralized, innovative approaches that maintain composable and unifying standards that are easy to deploy and corroborate with tools of decentralized Measurement, Reporting, and Validation (dMRV). This requires major innovation in the way we account for impact. We're currently supporting five innovative projects working to address this problem at the root of our impact accounting stack. Any donation you could make would go a long way in supporting this often underappreciated keystone in the #ReFi and impact investing sector.

 ### SproutUp [@SproutUpApp](http://twitter.com/sproutupapp)
 
 
 
 SproutUp is the impact certificate fundraising platform for web3 impact organizations. Impact certificates are NFT‚Äôs that represent one project output, such as a planted tree or bag of collected trash.
 
 
 
 Impact certificates are the new ‚Äúproducts‚Äù of the impact sector. Each donor will receive one or more certificates for their donation. Each SproutUp impact certificate consists of: a video of unique project impact; AI-generated cover art; and a name, description, and attributes.
 
 
 
 Impact certificates have two critical roles in climate impact verification.
 
 
 
 **1) Carbon credit alternative**
 
 
 
 Web3 refi has carbon credit tunnel vision. Carbon credits have an important but limited role‚Äîto offset ghg emissions. They apply to a small range of projects. They come with strict requirements. They are commoditized and sold in bulk, mostly to large corporate buyers. And they are, unfortunately, rife with fraud.
 
 
 
 Impact certificates are the opposite. They are individually unique. They can be creatively configured for a wide range of projects. And they are sold to ordinary donors.
 
 
 
 Impact certificates are for climate projects that need a flexible fundraising and verification toolkit.
 
 
 
 SproutUp will offer smart contract and NFT ‚Äúlegos‚Äù that each project can combine to fit their needs. A project could, for example, create tree NFTs (backed by verifiable impact) that produce carbon tokens for their holders. And the carbon tokens could in turn unlock further benefits.
 
 
 
 **2) True price accountability**
 
 
 
 What many miss about impact verification is it‚Äôs not just about the impact‚Äîbut also how much it costs.
 
 
 
 For every purchase, we need to know the price. The right product at the wrong price is the wrong purchase.
 
 
 
 The same is true of impact work. A donation is only worthwhile if funds are used effectively. However, there are no (real) prices in the impact space, and therefore, no cost-informed way for donors to allocate money.
 
 
 
 Tree planting nonprofits, for example, can prove they planted a million trees. However, they can‚Äôt prove that it only costs ‚Äú$1 per tree‚Äù to do it. Virtually every such claim today is false. If donors cannot connect the dots between their donation and a unique tree, there is no real price. Period.
 
 
 
 The ability to atomize project outputs (such as trees) into unique impact certificate NFTs is the critical link to creating price accountability. And subsequently the key to spurring impact sector efficiency and innovation.

 B√öAN is minting digital twins of RWA on Ethereum with a focus on environmentally valuable areas of land which can form the backing for impact certificates which can be sold to businesses. With the ultimate goal of rekindling societies relationship with nature. Think of us as The Federal Reserve before it moved away from the gold standard except our treasure is biodiversity. By developing the rails to on board RWA to the blockchain in a legally indemnifiable way we hope to encourage others to innovate within the same framework.

 - This Spring and Summer have brought many severe storms across the USA, and the power outages that come with them. The longest being 4 days without power at EverGreenCoin HQ. Snapped telephone poles across many states is undoubtedly an echo of climate change‚Äôs, as extreme weather events become more and more unpredictable and devastating. To mitigate these disruptions, battery backup equipment was purchased to power network infrastructure during power outages, that previously caused solar-powered nodes to lose connectivity during these outages. Together with solar and batter power, during these outages, EverGreenCoin will be in a much better position to not suffer non-critical service outages. Mission critical nodes are already generator backed up in world-class data centers with geographic redundancy across continents, for when, or if, these extreme weather events shutdown larger areas.
 
 - Expanded the reach, and ease of participation, in our flagship Proof of Environment program by allowing Facebook groups, under the lead of a PoE team manager who manages the group and team members‚Äô wallets, to form for the purpose of submitting evidence via the Facebook group. The team manager then vets the submission and, if requirements are meet, formally submits via the EverGreenCoin website. Even better, in the latest revision of this idea, the coins are staked, with staking rewards offsetting the administration time and costs. While wrinkles are still being ironed out, the effort has already rewarded PoE participants with their local currency in Africa, with more to soon come.

0x7bd2dc64d13a547bb12ce2afc015a2cfdc64c6530a7629568df17b2364b62ba8,Etherisc - Affordable Crop Insurance through Carbon Farming,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 
 
 
 Smallholder Farmers in Developing Nations are amongst the demographics most exposed to the devastating effects of climate change.
 
 
 
 The most effective tool to increase their resilience to climate risks is agricultural insurance. It pays out when they lose their crop due to bad weather. Parametric insurance models are particularly cost-effective. They work mainly with satellite data, weather indices and statistical models (rather than claims assessors).
 
 
 
 However, globally only about 3% of farmers are insured, mainly because insurance is expensive, intransparent and payouts are too slow.
 
 
 
 Etherisc has built an open source software platform that uses blockchain technology to make parametric insurance faster, cheaper and more transparent. Since 2018 we have a strong focus on agricultural insurance for smallholders in developing nations.
 
 
 
 In a number of live use cases we were able to show that our technology reduces payout times from the average 120 days after the end of the season to less than a week, with 40% of claims processed within 24 hours after the adverse weather event by mobile payment directly to the farmers‚Äô phone in local currency.
 
 
 
 An SMS based tool allowed status updates in real time to share the full transparency of all transactions on the public blockchain, which 80% of farmers used at least once a week and a majority reporting increased trust in the insurance.
 
 
 
 Our smart contracts minimized operational overheads and reduced the human processing steps leading to an 80% reduction in operational costs and a 27% increase in coverage amount.
 
 
 
 However, operational costs only represent about 80% of the overall premium. The rest is the cost of the actual risk.
 
 
 
 But if weather is becoming increasingly volatile, how will insurance for smallholders ever become affordable?
 
 
 
 Etherisc is hellbent on helping farmers to unlock an additional source of income from carbon farming activities.
 
 
 
 Smallholder farmers are trained to undertake simple carbon farming activities such as agroforestry and the use of biochar.
 
 
 
 The CO2 sequestered can be quantified and certified as carbon credits.
 
 
 
 When these certificates are sold, participating farmers will receive their share of the revenues, from which a part will be deducted immediately to cover insurance premiums.
 
 
 
 This approach could be a real game changer:
 
 
 
 We would stop trying to sell large amounts of small ticket policies to farmers who already struggle to afford them. Instead we offer them a tool to earn additional revenues and insurance just comes as part of the offer.
 
 
 
 Rather than the farmer, government or NGOs, larger corporations will be paying the premiums. And they are getting something in return: high quality carbon offsets for their net-zero strategies.
 
 
 
 We believe corporations would be willing to pay a premium to be part of such a powerful narrative.
 
 So this has the potential to finally mobilize significant private sector capital and reduce dependence on public funding.
 
 
 
 And the demand and prices on the Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) are expected to increase sharply.
 
 Why should smallholder farmers not get a share of this?
 
 
 
 A beautiful circularity: Those exposed to the effects of climate change are activated to fight it and in return they receive insurance and additional income so that they become more resilient against climate change.
 
 We think everyone involved would have something to gain for this approach:
 
 - Farmers increase their resilience to climate shocks and build a financial profile.
 
 - Climate: Several hundred million smallholder farmers worldwide could capture billions of tons of CO2 and make a significant contribution to global climate goals.
 
 - Rural Communities: will enjoy the usual ripple effects in health, food security, hygiene, local infrastructure and education that result from an increase in disposable income.
 
 - Purchasers meet their net zero targets while becoming part of a powerful narrative.
 
 - Insurers and Reinsurers will unlock the demographic of smallholders as a viable customer segment.
 
 - Governments can finally wean off unsustainable subsidy programs.
 
 - NGOs and donors: also gain a lot of efficiency due to the shared data and the audit trail created by our system.
 
 - Web3 Community: We could show how blockchain technology has the power to solve real problems outside the crypto-native space at massive scale with tremendous impact for the financially excluded.
 
 
 
 We currently have several opportunities to prove this concept in a pilot to show this model will be financially sustainable and can be scaled.
 
 
 
 One particular opportunity in Kenya includes our project partners from an ongoing pilot as well as Coorest and a partner on the ground with many years of experience in training farmers on agroforestry and biochar.
 
 
 
 What is currently required is a high profile name to act as the purchaser of some EUR 10k worth of carbon offsets. In addition the overall project costs of the pilot of about EUR 140k would require funding.
 
 
 
 
 
 DETAILS - CLIMATE RISK RESILIENCE THROUGH CARBON FARMING
 
 
 
 Connecting Smallholders to the Carbon Markets to access Crop Insurance
 
 
 
 A. Overview - The General Idea
 
 
 
 Despite a long track record of innovation in the climate risk and agricultural insurance space, two things remain out of reach: affordability for smallholder farmers and long-term financial sustainability for insurers. Most agricultural insurance programmes today, remain donor-funded or subsidized with low scalability prospects.
 
 
 
 We have to face one simple fact: With increasingly volatile weather the net cost of the risk is set to increase and will simply remain too high for smallholders.
 
 
 
 At the same time there is an urgent need to activate the populations of the global south to engage in the fight against climate change. As agriculture offers a myriad of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gasses and sequester carbon, it is vital to encourage the millions of smallholder farmers to adopt climate smart agricultural practices.
 
 
 
 We wish to tackle these problems by combining 3 elements: the carbon markets, insurance and blockchain technology. Our groundbreaking new concept proposes to offer farmers an additional source of income to increase their resilience against climate risks. Smallholder farmers can undertake simple carbon farming activities such as agroforestry and the use of biochar. Using cutting edge satellite technology, the CO2 sequestered by such activities can be tracked, quantified, verified remotely and eventually certified as carbon offset certificates. When these certificates are sold on the carbon markets, participating farmers will receive their share of the sales revenues, from which a part can be deducted immediately to cover insurance premiums. The end-to-end transactions would be executed and tracked on Etherisc‚Äôs blockchain platform.
 
 
 
 B. Benefits
 
 
 
 Our concept therefore democratizes the carbon markets rather than restricting them to the larger players. Etherisc platform is fully inclusive and allows everyone to participate and receive rewards for the carbon they capture on one single platform, where all digital assets and payments are exchanged in real time. It therefore brings speed, cost-efficiency and transparency to three sectors that have traditionally been slow, inefficient, expensive and intransparent: the carbon markets, smallholder commodity farming and insurance.
 
 
 
 Smallholder farmers: This new way of income generation for smallholder farmers will not only improve their livelihoods and increase their resilience to climate shocks, but will also reduce their risk profile to unlock additional financial services such as microcredits. At the same time, agroforestry farming strategies brings about better soil quality, pest and disease resistance, drought resistance, moisture retention and improved biodiversity, which generally leads to reduced climate vulnerability of the farmland.
 
 
 
 Global CO2 Reduction & SDGs: With an estimated 270 million smallholder farmers worldwide, bringing such a program to scale using modern remote sensing satellite technologies could capture billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere and make a significant contribution to global CO2 reduction targets as well as SDGs 01 (No Poverty), 02 (Zero Hunger), 08 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Life on Land), and 17 (Partnerships to achieve the Goal).
 
 
 
 Rural farming communities: This additional revenue source for rural farming communities will not only contribute to their financial resilience, but will also show the known ripple effects in health, food security, hygiene, local infrastructure and education that result from an increase in disposable income. This will lead to the empowerment of the lives and livelihoods of entire communities of those who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
 
 
 
 Carbon Offset Purchasers: Due to these additional social benefits, purchasing the carbon offsets from such a program will first of all become a very attractive strategy of meeting their net zero targets for large corporations, and will also become a central element of their CSR and branding strategy.
 
 
 
 Insurers and Reinsurers: For insurers and reinsurers, the additional revenue available to pay realistic premiums will unlock the demographic of smallholder farming communities in developing nations as a viable customer segment. Other stakeholders in the insurance value chain such as brokers and tech service providers no longer need to slice up premiums into ever-reducing margins, at the expense of the farmer.
 
 Governments: Effective protection to their citizens and mitigation of disaster relief costs and phasing out unsustainable subsidy programs for agricultural insurance, all while contributing to net-zero targets.
 
 
 
 NGOs: By using blockchain and smart contracts precise, targeted and conditional micropayments become possible. It also brings speed, cost-efficiency and transparency to three sectors that have traditionally been slow, inefficient, expensive and intransparent: the carbon markets, smallholder commodity farming and insurance. Keeping in mind the importance of accurate reporting and audit trails, NGOs, donors and government entities that provide funding and assistance in this field also have a lot to gain from this technology. Eventually, we will even open up directly to the end consumer.
 
 
 
 Our concept therefore democratizes the carbon markets and allows everyone to participate and receive rewards for the carbon they capture, while previously only larger players with the initial capital to pay for the administrative overheads of traditional certifications had access.
 
 
 
 C. Piloting the Concept
 
 
 
 We have identified an opportunity to pilot this groundbreaking new approach to generating carbon offsets and providing access to insurance in Kenya, where we can bring together a number of relevant stakeholders to pilot this groundbreaking new approach in Kenya.
 
 
 
 
 
 D. The Stakeholders
 
 
 
 The farmer is at the center of this project. Farmers are offered participation in the carbon farming and they are the ones who will be executing the climate smart farming strategies that will generate nature-based carbon offsets which will bring the revenue to make their communities more resilient to climate risks and pay for agricultural insurance.
 
 
 
 Role: A group of ca. 100 farmer families is already onboarded with Coorest and have been trained on carbon farming strategies, some of these families are already generating CCO2 Tokens under Coorest‚Äôs standard. All the onboarded families are participating in agroforestry and dispose of mobile phones and mobile payment wallets (MPESA), which will allow them to onboard individually on Etherisc‚Äôs platform in the same way we are already onboarding farmers with Acre Africa elsewhere in Kenya.
 
 
 
 A Dutch Organisation with boots on the ground can activate the first participating farmers based on their local presence from the communities of smallholders that they are already working with. They have been providing the necessary training on the relevant agroforestry practices. The organisation has been active in Kenya for over 15 years and is developing a community hub. It already has 10 years of experience in developing reforestation activities in Kenya and in 2021 started cooperating with UNEP and FAO and was able to increase the number of farmers by 175% growing tens of thousands of trees.
 
 
 
 Role: A total of 64 farmer families with 32 hectares could be activated to participate in this pilot. These families have already been trained and are actively carbon farming, some already under CCO2 Standard. They would share the relevant mobile numbers of the participating farmers, so that the trees located on their fields that are absorbing the CO2 from the atmosphere and their representations as NFTs (NFTrees) on the blockchain and the CCO2 Tokens that are generated by them can all be linked to the individual farmer who owns them through GeoJson files that map everything on Coorest‚Äôs platform. This will allow the platform to:
 
 - channel the payment for the carbon offsets that were generated by the trees directly to the mobile payment wallets of the farmers that own the land on which they located,
 
 - Deduct a small amount for their respective insurance premium from such payments,
 
 - channel any insurance payouts directly to the mobile payment wallets of the farmers that own the land in case there is too much or too little moisture.
 
 - direct communication with the farmers by USSD/SMS through Etheirsc‚Äôs platform.
 
 
 
 
 
 Acre Africa: is the locally licensed insurance intermediary with over 4M farmers insured to date. They offer Agriculture risk mitigation services that include; insurance product design, insurance distribution, blockchain based risk monitoring and claims management (integrated on Etheric‚Äôs GIF) with a very strong insurance and reinsurance support network to secure the necessary capital backing. Moreover, they manage an on-the-ground distribution network of local ‚Äúvillage champions‚Äù that deliver training, extension services and risk mitigation solutions to farmers. Acre shares the vision of increasing their farmers‚Äô resilience with additional income from carbon farming activities. Their backing from a pan-African reinsurer Zep-Re, Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture and Grameen Foundation offers the potential for significant scaling up farmer onboarding after a first pilot.
 
 
 
 Role: Acre configures ratings for the agriculture insurance product underwritten by their insurance partner, which covers the relevant crops farmed by the group of farmers in the program (primarily maize, beans, sorghum and green grams). Acre would then distribute the individual covers to the participating farmers. Based on their phone numbers, and location of the farm their policies would be individually monitored in real time. A USSD menu could be used to communicate with farmers. The necessary insurance products are already integrated on Etherisc‚Äôs platform from the work with Acre in previous seasons, which use a trigger based on a soil moisture index.
 
 
 
 Some of the farmers currently insured by Acre are already practicing agroforestry and could be onboarded next to add scale. Acre is also working on other programs relating to reforestation projects, which would be a rapid scale up path in Africa.
 
 
 
 
 
 Etherisc has created and maintains the open-source tech platform based on blockchain technology (Generic Insurance Framework or ‚ÄúGIF‚Äù). It allows end-to-end automation and processing of insurance policies and all payment flows. Etherisc has been working successfully together with Acre Africa for 3 years as well as with other insurers like Lemonade, Pula, WFP and ARC in Kenya and elsewhere with over 90k farmers insured on Etherisc‚Äôs platform by 2023.
 
 
 
 Role: Etherisc will provide the necessary technical services to ensure all actors collaborate seamlessly to onboard and integrate their data and services. The insurance product will run on Etherisc‚Äôs platform. The insurance products for the mentioned corps are already configured on the platform. The data sources that monitor the soil moisture information and trigger the policy according to the parametric index are already integrated. Payment channels are integrated through API to manage all payment flows for premiums and payouts. Revenue shares from the sale of carbon offsets could be paid through the same channels. When the concept goes to scale post-pilot, Etherisc‚Äôs platform can also deduct smaller platform fees from the carbon revenues and channel payments to all stakeholders providing the individual services.
 
 
 
 
 
 Coorest is the first blockchain-based, certified carbon compensation provider. Coorest‚Äôs smart contracts use satellite data from Floodlight to validate the generation of new tokens to make carbon compensation transparent and accountable. Coorest‚Äôs $CCO2 tokens are issued under its own recognized and audited carbon standard and can be traded or burnt to compensate emissions against a proof of carbon compensation certificate (PoCC). Coorest‚Äôs platform is equipped with a payment gateway (on-/off-ramp) for credit card payments to minimize friction of purchase transactions. Coorest also has an existing customer base of purchasers. (Note: Coorest‚Äôs NFTrees initiative links non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to real-world trees, which generate $CCO2 tokens at a predetermined rate each year representing the carbon their real-life counterparts removed from the atmosphere. The holders of NFTrees will start collecting $CCO2 once a tree is planted.)
 
 
 
 Role: Some of the participating families are already onboarded with Coorest as a group and monitoring of their CO2 sequestration is ongoing. The resulting CCO2 tokens are transferred automatically and in real time by the smart contracts on Coorest's platform, while deducting the respective fees. All necessary data sources and payment channels are already integrated. 
 
 What remains to be done is onboard additional farmers to generate CCO2 and to connect the carbon sequestration data to the payment flows on Etherisc‚Äôs platform, as it will be crucial to show that the farmers receive exactly the share of revenues that relates to the CCO2 Tokens that the trees on their land have generated. Coorest's platform will provide a powerful tool for reporting meticulously about all the data that went into the creation of the carbon offsets.
 
 
 
 
 
 Coorest has an existing partner that takes care of data collection and analysis. They use satellite data to track and monitor biomass for ESG investing and are able to provide data to confirm the exact amount of CO2 sequestered. The data is sent to blockchains through a network of oracles.
 
 
 
 Role: Coorest has already integrated the data sources from their partner and has an ongoing business relationship with them. The trees situated on the land of the additional farmer families in Kenya that will be onboarded already, will need to be added to the monitoring by their partner. Etherisc‚Äôs team also has an existing working relationship with them from ongoing work on a proof of concept.
 
 
 
 
 
 Another partner provides 'oracle networks', data feeds securing data sources for use by smart contracts on a blockchain. All actors are already integrated with that provider.
 
 
 
 Role: Coorest's platform already receives the MRV data from the satelites through these oracles. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Blockchain: All smart contracts could be deployed on Ethereum or any other EVM-compatible blockchain. All actors are already integrated with several such blockchains, some of which already have shown strong dedication to carbon neutrality and leaving a minimal carbon footprint based on proof of stake.
 
 
 
 Role: We hoping to discuss the possibility of financial support from the blockchain where such a pilot will be deployed. Gas fees need to be discussed as this needs to work for the context of smallholder farmers. It would be immensely useful, if Ethereum could support the project from a tech development and/or from a PR point of view as well.
 
 
 
 
 
 Buyer of the carbon credits is offered a way to offset their own carbon footprint by purchasing the $CCO2 tokens generated in the project as part of their net-zero strategy. As an added value to their carbon credit purchase they find themselves at the center of a powerful narrative on reducing carbon emissions while uplifting and protecting entire communities as part of CSR and ESG strategy.
 
 
 
 Role: This is the key partner that still needs to be identified. This would be the party that purchases the CCO2 Tokens that the participating farmers have generated before the start of the pilot and receives these tokens in a wallet. By doing so the purchaser essentially funds the entire program. (With 32 ha producing around 6 eCO2t per hectare per year and a price per ton of EUR 75.00, we expect a total sales price of around EUR 15k.) We would offer these for sale in bulk at the best price that can be agreed with the purchaser. The premium for the group policy that needs to be paid to Acre will need to come out of the purchase price. Therefore, we need to negotiate a price with the purchaser that still leaves a significant revenue to the farmers that is in line with their expectations.
 
 
 
 
 
 E. Potential for Scale and added Functionalities
 
 
 
 The concept, as well as the platform itself, are a key step towards future innovations:
 
 
 
 Once built, the open-source approach of Coorest and Etherisc ensures that the platform can also be easily replicated and deployed in other markets, in relation to different mitigation activities (AWD irrigation for rice farming, biochar, mangrove and wetland restoration etc.) by Etherisc/Coorest and/or other teams with a different set of partners on similar projects for the best possible scale.
 
 
 
 The demand and price on the Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) alone (!) for additional high quality carbon offsets from similar programs are expected to increase sharply. The number of companies setting net-zero targets is increasing exponentially (and tripled from 2019 to 2020 alone from 500 to 1,565). Therefore, some estimations project further growth by at least 3-4 times until 2030 - some estimations predicting growth to a total market value of USD 50B.
 
 
 
 Partnerships could be built to offer insurance to farmers who are already adopting agroforestry strategies (like in the Acorn or Nespresso initiatives for example) to make them more resilient.
 
 
 
 All project stakeholders have extensive networks access to suitable scaling partners and private investors like development focused governmental and non-governmental agencies, insurance and reinsurance companies. Larger multinational food processing companies looking to offset their own carbon emissions in their own supply chain (while stabilizing supply by protecting their producers and uplifting their livelihoods) will be an obvious group of purchasers to target. There are many actors in the Carbon Markets who are looking to Web3 technologies, to improve transparency and to solve other shortcomings of the traditional carbon markets, such as the EU, Gold Standard, Verra, Climate Action Data Trust and Climate Warehouse.
 
 
 
 Some believe that because of the obvious technological benefits there is a fair probability that the carbon markets could be one of the first industry sectors where blockchain technology will be breakthrough into the mainstream.
 
 
 
 F. Impact and learnings
 
 
 
 The 64 farmer families with ca. 32 hectares could over 40 tCO2e per year.
 
 
 
 These numbers would be sufficient to prove the concept in a live pilot before the approach can be scaled as mentioned above.
 
 
 
 Assuming an average 0.25 hectares per farm and a sales price of approx. USD 75.00, each family would receive an additional income of USD 112.50 per year.
 
 Once we are able to onboarded Acre‚Äôs farmers, we can add an estimated 30,000 farmers to these numbers, each with an average field size of about 1 hectare, which would start to generate some interesting scale, i.e. 180,000 tCO2e and an additional annual revenue of USD 450.00 per farmer per year.
 
 
 
 The following SDGs would be positively impacted by the initiative:
 
 
 
 SDG 1 - No Poverty: Carbon credits increase their income and help to lift farmers out of poverty. Insurance avoids farmers falling under the poverty line in case of extreme weather events that wipe out their season‚Äôs harvest.
 
 
 
 SDG 2 - Zero Hunger: More disposable income means more purchasing power to cover daily needs. Insurance payments replace homegrown food of subsistence farmers.
 
 
 
 SDG 5 - Gender Equality: 60% of smallholder farmers are women and the majority of policyholders are women.
 
 
 
 SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: Diversified farming income (crop and carbon) becomes more reliable/stable and insurance allows for taking entrepreneurial risks and credit to stimulate growth.
 
 
 
 SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities: Financial services become more inclusive, climate risks are not born solely by farmers and carbon markets are democratized.
 
 
 
 SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities: Entire communities can flourish based on the increase of disposable income of the farmers.
 
 
 
 SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: Farmers are producing in a climate smart way sequesters carbon and farms are becoming less exposed to natural risks.
 
 
 
 SDG 13 - Climate Action: Effects of climate change are mitigated and farmers' resilience is increased as adaptation to climate risks.
 
 
 
 SDG 15 - Life on Land: Carbon farming activities halt desertification and land degradation and improve soil quality, pest and disease resistance, drought resistance, moisture retention and biodiversity.

 How blockchain technology adds value:
 
 - Ability to transact targeted, precise and conditional micropayments due to use of smart contracts
 
 - Reduction of operational costs (previous projects have shown 80% reduction),
 
 - Streamlining processes and acceleration of claims cycles (previous projects have shown reduction from 120 days to 24 hours - 5 days)
 
 - Full traceability of all data of carbon mitigation activities by individual farmers
 
 - Democratization of access of smallholder farmers to VCM
 
 - Provide real-time accurate reporting and audit trails for all stakeholders, particularly funders and investors
 
 
 
 
 
 G. Consortium‚Äôs proposal and ask
 
 
 
 Timeline: Depending on how fast information on locations and crops is shared and depending on how fast we can find funding and a purchaser, we might be able to roll out a live pilot for the short rain season starting in September 2023. Ideally we would run the pilot for several seasons. Once set up additional seasons of operation should not increase the costs significantly.
 
 
 
 Total funding of USD 143,000. A high-level breakdown is as follows:
 
 - Project management (Etherisc Impact) USD 15,000
 
 - Technical platform development and integration (Etherisc GmbH) USD 15,000
 
 - Actuarial Development and policy management (Risk Model Customization,monitoring and claims) (Acre Africa) USD 20,000
 
 - Technical development (Coorest) USD15,000
 
 Measurement, registration and verification (Floodlight) USD15,000
 
 - On the ground project development (64 farmers) USD45,000
 
 - Travel USD 11,000
 
 - Impact evaluation USD 5,000 or in-kind
 
 Technical assistance, testing & farmer capacity building USD 2,000 or in-kind
 
 
 
 
 
 H. Potential Scaling Partners:
 
 
 
 All project stakeholders have extensive networks in the relevant spaces that will make it easy to attract further partners, grant funding and eventually investment.
 
 
 
 A few avenues we are currently exploring:
 
 
 
 - private organizations are already doing similar work - orgnisations with access to larger groups of farmers 
 
 - offtakes and food processing companies, also as purchasers of carbon credits.
 
 - Development focused governmental and non-governmental agencies
 
 - international organisations that are rolling out their own insurance programs (several showed interest in this approach).
 
 - WFP and its partners have a huge interest in risk mitigation and disaster risk financing mechanisms 
 
 - Insurance and reinsurance companies covering agricultural and climate related risks.
 
 - actors in the web3 space also have a keen interest in climate risk mitigation including offsetting their own carbon footprint such as Ethereum Foundation, Polygon, Binance, Chainlink and Celo all of which we know and have worked with.
 
 - actors in the Carbon Markets who are looking to Web3 technologies, to improve transparency"

The central focus is on leveraging eco-friendly materials such as hemp, which not only provides a resource for slow fashion but also contributes positively to the ecosystem. Vanara has recently incorporated Ahimsa silk, a non-violent approach to silk production, aligning with their ethos of ethical and cruelty-free methods.
 
 
 
 ### Project Impact on Regeneration:
 
 
 
 * **Ethical Production:** Transitioning to cruelty-free production ensures the well-being of sentient creatures.
 
 
 
 * **Enhanced Biodiversity&Regeneration :** The non-violent approach to silk farming promotes biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. Hemp cultivation contributes positively to the soil, cleaning and rejuvenating it.
 
 * **Cultural Preservation:** By promoting ancient, humane methods of production, Vanara preserves traditional craftsmanship and the cultural heritage of Anatolia.
 
 * **Education and Awareness:** Through the usage of materials like Ahimsa silk and hemp, consumers are educated about ethical alternatives, encouraging a shift in consumption patterns.
 
 * **Harmony with Nature:** Both hemp and Ahimsa silk represent a symbiotic relationship with nature, highlighting respect for all living entities.
 
 
 
 ### Training Initiative:
 
 Vanara is keen on equipping artisans with knowledge and skills related to regenerative practices. This comprehensive training encompasses:
 
 
 
 - Introduction to regenerative concepts and their importance.
 
 - Deep insights into materials like hemp and Ahimsa silk.
 
 - Promoting traditional craftsmanship while integrating innovation.
 
 - Emphasizing regenerative agriculture practices such as soil health, biodiversity, and water management.
 
 - Principles of sustainable design and zero-waste crafting.
 
 - Collaboration and cultural preservation.
 
 - Integration of technology, especially Web3 & Blockchain, for product traceability and transparency.
 
 - Continuous learning, feedback, advocacy, and community outreach.
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Blockchain Integration:
 
 Introducing a blockchain layer would greatly enhance Vanara's operations by:
 
 
 
 1. Traceability: Ensuring the ethical sourcing and authenticity of materials.
 
 2. Transparency: Providing clarity to consumers regarding the origins and production methods of each product.
 
 3. Public Goods: Through the transparent nature of blockchain, Vanara can further establish its dedication to public welfare and the betterment of the ecosystem, giving consumers more trust and confidence in their purchases.
 
 
 
 **Vanara's initiative not only aims to redefine the production landscape by using sustainable materials but also seeks to reshape consumption habits by offering products that are ethically sourced and produced. The integration of blockchain adds an additional layer of trust, transparency, and accountability, bolstering Vanara's efforts in promoting regeneration and sustainable practices.**"

It provides detailed information about vegetation health, growth, and distribution through our algorithms and machine learning models. This information is stored in a blockchain-based system for secure and decentralized data sharing among stakeholders. LeafTrack acts as an early warning system for changes in the vegetation layer, enabling reserve managers to make well-informed decisions.
 
 
 
 LeafTrack aims to impact nature reserves by providing reliable and scalable monitoring of vegetation. Specifically, it aims to:
 
 
 
 1. Help protect endangered species: Monitoring changes in vegetation health, growth, and distribution can help identify areas that require more attention or intervention. For instance, reserve managers can take action to remove invasive species and prevent them from harming endangered species.
 
 2. Prevent deforestation: Monitoring changes in the vegetation layer helps identify areas at risk of deforestation. Reserve managers will now be able to take action to prevent illegal logging or land conversion and protect the forest.
 
 3. Promote sustainable agriculture: Monitoring changes in the vegetation layer helps identify areas suitable for sustainable agriculture. Reserve managers can take action to improve soil quality and prevent further degradation if there is evidence of soil degradation or erosion.
 
 4. Provide scientific data for research: The project provides reliable and detailed data on vegetation health, growth, and distribution. This data will support scientific research on ecology, climate change, and other environmental topics."

 This project was first established to support Indigenous activists working on the front lines of fights against the Trans Mountain Pipeline ""expansion"" project (TMX). It then expanded to include their legal battle as well as other Indigenous legal battles to hold governments and large infrastructure companies accountable for their actions on climate change.
 
 
 
 Holding fossil fuel companies and governments accountable for climate change and other environmental damage through legal court cases is complex and expensive. But it can be extremely effective!
 
 
 
  Indigenous Nations and groups pursuing this course of action need support.
 
 
 
 Cases have been fought and won using rights and standing laws, environmental regulations, tort laws, human rights-based litigation, Fiduciary duty litigation, government accountability lawsuits and international and national treaty litigation. 
 
 
 
 We have worked with and helped fund:
 
 
 
 **The Tiny House Warriors:** Ten tiny houses were placed in the path of the Trans Mountain pipeline. This action was a way of asserting control over the traditional unceded Secwepemc territory, where the company proposed building part of the pipeline. They have been criminalized and forced to defend their land in court.
 
 
 
 **Sundance Chief Rueben George and the George family:** The George family, as part of their Nation‚Äôs (Tsleil Waututh) Sacred Trust initiative have been actively fighting the Trans Mountain pipeline both on the front lines and in court for over a decade. If the project were to go ahead it would mean massive and ongoing increases (instead of decreases) to the amount of carbon intensive tar sands oil extracted, and exported via oil tankers and then burned every year. This means huge risks for local people and ecosystems and its a big step in the wrong direction for the climate.
 
 
 
 Chief George has also been supporting the Wet'suwet'en Nation and travelling to Camp 44 as they fight, on the ground, in prison and in the courts against the Coastal GasLink pipeline that, if built will be carrying fracked gas to LNG Canada‚Äôs (LNG Canada is a joint venture between Shell, PETRONAS, PetroChina, Mitsubishi and KOGAS) export terminal.
 
 
 
 **We Stand Together:** As an off-shoot of the Canada/FIPA challenge was formed to craft legal
 
 challenges to government decisions on climate. They are presently gathering additional Indigenous allies in support of a First Nations legal climate challenge as well as targeted media, education and public engagement work.
 
 
 
 **The Canada/China FIPA challenge:** The Hupacasath Nation choose to fight this trade treaty as it gave unprecedented powers to China‚Äôs state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that were investing billions in Canada‚Äôs natural resources. The treaty allowed SOE‚Äôs to sue any Canada entities or governments for all future profits if they caused the SOE‚Äôs to be unable to do business in Canada. The treaty was irreversible by any court, legislature or other decision-maker for 31 years and had a 15 year out clause. The Hupacasath Nation and We Stand Together crowd-sourced $400,000 to pay for the court case, with donations from over 3,000 people.
 
 
 
 In this next round we will continue to support Chief George, the Tiny House Warriors, We Stand Together and also will be supporting the Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen Climate challenge through RAVEN trust (see below)
 
 
 
 **Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen Legal Action:** A Constitutional challenge asking the Federal Court to declare that Canada has a constitutional duty to keep the country‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions well within the Paris Agreement limit of 2 C above pre-industrial levels. If successful, the lawsuit could lead to far-reaching changes to Canada‚Äôs environmental legislation. It would enable the federal cabinet to cancel approvals previously given to fossil fuel projects such as the LNG export facilities and pipelines proposed for Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen Territories and the northwest B.C. region. Canadian courts recognized that the Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen Hereditary Chiefs hold rights and title over ancestral lands.
 
 
 
 *‚ÄúFor decades, the government's actions and inactions have been a dominant factor in climate change and have violated the unceded rights of First Nations. At 'We stand Together', we believe we have strong legal grounds to challenge the federal/provincial government to uphold their fiduciary responsibility to First Nations peoples and protect the health of the next seven times seven generations.""* - Brenda Sayers, Hupacasath First Nation
 
 
 
 As Canada continues to wrestle with what reconciliation with Indigenous peoples means, Indigenous Nations have been pushing both human rights laws and the laws of nature to the forefront with persuasive court cases that have stopped many, large industrial projects from not only destroying their traditional lands but the rights of us all of us for a healthy planet.
 
 
 
 First Nations activists have been leading the opposition to these projects around the world. It
 
 has been our honor to work with and support their efforts. Please join us in supporting these amazing activists in their ongoing fight."

 We have a team of passionate volunteers organizing activities that benefit the community, our oceans, and the world. As our divers continue their journey through the Americas and the world, we want them to leave the island with the ability to spread knowledge and the ability to take action.

 Beach cleanups: Our regular beach cleanups have occurred for a number of years, focusing on a particularly hard hit section of the island. On this beach, small bits of broken down plastic and micro plastics are mixed homogeneously with sand and coral. We regularly remove hundreds of pounds of plastic from these beaches, removing debris that are commonly consumed by sea birds, fish, and the island's endangered turtles. While we have made tremendous progress, no one on the island is prepared for the tremendous amounts of broken down plastic. While participants for these cleanups are volunteers, transportation, disposal fees, and hauling fees have been the limiting factor to the frequency of these events. In addition, with funding, we could purchase mechanized systems that separate unwanted debris while returning sand and rock back to the beach to be used by marine life. This would allow us to make significant strides in rehabilitating our badly damaged beaches.

 Dive Against Debris: Through PADI Aware‚Äôs Dive Against Debris program, Underwater Vision and its patrons collect trash from the depths of the ocean. Ranging from water bottles and fish nets to couches and refrigerators that require lift bags to remove from the ocean floor. Surveys are conducted on these dives and submitted to Dive Against Debris to be used to inform policy change. These activities are conducted by volunteers which keeps the cost low, however, with additional funding, we could increase the frequency of these events and get ahead of the problem by assisting local communities with alternative, safe, and effective trash disposal options.

 Utila Coral Nursery Maintenance: As with most places around the world, Utila has seen a decline in coral reef cover. Divers have helped protect the reef from many threats, however, bleaching, coral diseases, pollution, and historic damage have still left their mark. While mitigation and conservation are prioritized, restoration can not be overlooked as a necessary component of the triage needed to save our reefs. Underwater Vision has an in house coral nursery program tailored by our world renowned Course Director, Grace Williams. While other efforts on the island for a coral restoration program have stagnated, we have the expertise needed to kick this program into full swing. Grace Williams has been working with local NGOs and Utilas municipal government to secure the appropriate permits to start a full scale coral nursery and restoration program. Thanks to a robust recreational dive program, a dramatic increase in eco tourism, and an established, high recruitment of volunteers, funding needs for this program can be kept much lower than comparable projects around the world. As funding is secured, we will begin building our coral nursery in our shallow and protected house reef. With the proper equipment for coral fragmentation, corals from the nursery can then be fragmented, grown out further, then outplanted to damaged sites around the island.

 Stony Coral Tissue Loss Treatment and Survey: Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease is a highly contagious coral disease that has swept through the carribean in recent years. While likely the most deadly coral disease in history, all hope is not lost. Underwater Vision takes on survey efforts to monitor the spread of the disease and when possible, treats the affected corals with antibiotics. While labor intensive, the treatment has been effective in stopping the spread of the disease on individual corals. The alternative is to let the disease kill many decades of coral growth in a matter of weeks. The cost of antibiotics, while not exorbitant, has been cost prohibitive. We currently treat corals once per month, we would like to treat corals once per week.

 Compost: While our composting project is still in the planning stages, It tackles an important issue and is worth mentioning. Excess nutrients from discarded food wreak havoc on our environment. If taken to a landfill, this biomass breaks down in hypoxic conditions, releasing methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than CO2. If dumped in the ocean, it feeds algae growth that can smother and kill corals. Currently, food waste on the island is discarded to a landfill. We hope to recycle some of these nutrients through composting. Using food waste, nitrogen rich manure from local, small scale poultry farms, and lawn clippings, we can convert these waste products into a nutrient rich fertilizer that can be used by food producers on the island. While not directly diving related, there is ample interest in this project within the dive community to integrate it into a broader eco program. While the costs for such a project are low, startup costs for basic equipment on the island have been a limiting factor. 
 
 
 
 Recycling: Curbing single use plastic is of top priority, however, what happens with current single use plastic should not be overlooked. Plastic on the island is currently collected with municipal waste, separated, and shipped to mainland for further distribution and processing. As technology evolves and becomes more open sourced, systems for small scale plastic recycling are now within reach. Currently in the wish list phase, with a relatively small investment, Underwater Vision could begin collecting, sorting, shredding, and making plastic objects such as cups, tupperware, wetsuit hangers, underwater survey clipboards, and many more useful items that we currently have a hard time sourcing on the island out of recycled plastic.

 Fish Survey: How many fish are on the reef every year? This is a question that scientist try to work out on a regular basis. Underwater Vision is currently making efforts to increase its participation in the REEF Foundation‚Äôs fish survey program. With this program, recreational divers can make every dive a survey in which their collected data can be used to track fish populations and inform policy decisions around the world. 
 
 
 
 Coral Watch: While treating diseased corals and propagating new corals is invaluable, a lot can be gained by collecting data on the corals we still have. Using survey methods created by the University Of Queensland, divers can collect data on corals to monitor coral bleaching. 
 
 
 
 Eco Organizing: A program still in the planning stages, Eco Organizing will teach scuba divers how to start, grow, and assist grassroots projects. We hope to create leaders in environmental action that can go out into the world and be a catalyst for change.

We need international cooperation to urgently reduce methane emissions as much as possible this decade‚Äù said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP.‚Äù
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Another largely unknown connection between outdated sanitation methods and intestinal parasites is leaching from pit latrines in the developing world. Millions suffer and die yearly due to this phenomena, which is being tackled via treatment and not by cutting off the source of the problem: outdated methods of dealing with human waste.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Our solution:
 
 
 
 Our patent pending invention is expected to significantly enhance the well being of people worldwide. While also making a big contribution to the mitigation of greenhouse gases. This invention is called the Detritivore Lavatory Bioregenerative Hygiene System - D-LAV for short. For the past several years we have been developing a device that utilizes biological agents called detritivores to consume human bioregeneratives (wrongly labeled toilet ""waste"" ) and food scrap leftovers that would otherwise go into toxic landfills. 
 
 
 
 The primary detritivore insect we have chosen are called black soldier fly larvae - the most effective consumers of decaying biological material known. Utilizing these insects inside the D-LAV replaces out-dated and highly problematic sanitation systems that leave decaying biological materials to emit greenhouse gases. The main GHG we are targeting is methane, which is more than 80 times more damaging than C02 to our atmosphere over the first couple of decades after release. According to United Nations climate experts mitigation of methane gas is the most effective thing we can do to stop global warming.
 
 
 
 
 
 Technological innovation to produce a transportable prototype:
 
 
 
  We have created basic prototypes with results similar to the research of many others, on the capacity of black soldier fly larvae to consume human bioregeneratives. With a goal of protecting the operations of the D-LAV and detritivores, while making it transferable for others to observe. Khepera DIO will be utilizing a portion of the Gitcoin grant procedes, towards an artificial intelligence driven 3-d animation to create our D-LAV prototype. Once this has been completed and distributed to the appropriate persons and institutions of interest, Khepera will then proceed to the 3-D printing of D-LAV prototypes.
 
 
 
 For those seeking direct and actual video proof of the capacities of these insects to devour biological materials see various YouTube videos. Here's a sample; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyZflghuzFI
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Where this will be deployed:
 
 
 
 Khepera's D-LAV and associated projects will be introduced first in the Global South as a means to compensate for widespread lack of hygiene and sanitation facilities. We have chosen The Gambia west Africa because they reached out to us after our United Nations presentation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Brief Logistics:
 
 
 
 Our plan calls for perfecting the prototype and tech stack, then the rolling out of a test pilot in West Africa in The Gambia. We will eventually be incorporating sensor technology into the D-LAV. As well as utilizing blockchain and a tradable NFT economy, very similar to the model outlined in last year‚Äôs Gitcoin essay. This inspiring article called for a DIO project to galvanize forces effectively in the climate change battle, which is precisely what Khepera DIO has been developing over the past 6 years. But our economic model is even more innovative because Khepera DIO has discovered the value (now wasted) in bioregenerative matter. We have devised a means to mine this value via the D-LAV and will use blockchain tech to share and distribute it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Detailed logistics:
 
 
 
 Khepera is seeking $1 million dollars for a year of activity via this proposal.
 
 
 
 Goals: D-LAV finalization, blockchain tech stack development, staff payments and rollout of 1 BIOREGENATIVE HYGIENE COMMUNITY BUNDLE (BHCB) in The GAMBIA, West Africa. A local BHCB involved a local school, a number of local households and a number of public facilities utilizing the D-LAV, along with associated facilities and local workers.
 
 
 
 The funding goals breakdown:
 
 
 
 D-LAV prototyping via artificial intelligence and 3D printing - $75,000
 
 
 
 Blockchain tech stack developing- $150,000
 
 
 
 Khepera‚Äôs staff and business overhead - $150,000
 
 
 
 D-LAV's for 1000 families - $200,000 (BHCB)
 
 
 
 Local Gambian BIOREGENATIVE essentials processing facility- $150000 (BHCB)
 
 
 
 Local Gambian workers - $100,000 (BHCB) 
 
 
 
  Travel - $75,000
 
 
 
 Promotion - $50,000
 
 
 
 Blockchain Education Curriculum - $25,000
 
 
 
 $25,000 miscellaneous
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Details on the Khepera BIOREGENATIVE HYGIENE COMMUNITY BUNDLE. This bundle will include:
 
 
 
 SCHOOL FACILITIES:
 
 
 
 6-10 DLAV BIOREGENATIVE HYGIENE STATIONS PER SCHOOL
 
 
 
 BHB PUBLIC BLOCKS:
 
 
 
 25 local BIOREGENATIVE HYGIENE BLOCKs consisting 50 private male and female DLAV stations. All stations would produce bioregenative essentials that would feed a ring of flowers surrounding the stations. The ring of flowers and DLAVS would surround a combination food crop and fish farming facility fed by the BIOREGENATIVE essentials created by the community. This food would be provided as cost to the local community and provide plants for supplement production to the local community BIOREGENATIVE essentials logistics and processing facility.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Introduction of anew economic paradigm:
 
 
 
 This shared value, along with carbon credits generated from GHG emission mitigation, will be the basis for what we call a ""blockchained bioregenerative income"" (BBI) model. Derived from the good health of people instead of a basic income scheme handed down from government derived fiat currencies, the BBI will at last align the well being of people with the economic well being of nations. 
 
 
 
 This income generated by the schools would go toward paying educational costs. The income generated by the families would go toward them as BBI and for growing the system into new communities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Khepera's strong allies:
 
 
 
 Taking advantage of alliances we have formed with the United Nations and several Hollywood celebrities - like award winning director Bill Duke and actor & former UN Goodwill ambassador Danny Glover - Khepera DIO is optimistic that we can generate the attention needed to get the word out. 
 
 
 
 We have already formed a relationship with The Gambia where we have been invited to bring our tech. We plan to pilot in schools, medical care facilities and carefully chosen Gambian communities as a proving ground for later national, then worldwide deployment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Khepera's media promotional plan:
 
 
 
 Mr. Bill Duke, one of Hollywood‚Äôs most respected acting and directing talents, has offered to do a documentary about this proposed pilot that we hope will generate interest to further fund the worldwide rollout. As a blockchain/tech enthusiast himself, we feel this award winning director would properly showcase this project as the ultimate utility for crypto and REFI in a professional, far reaching manner.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The team:
 
 
 
  We are blockchain enthusiasts, scientists, artists and inventors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Khepera team:
 
 
 
 Gregory Walker - founder and inventor of the DLAV. Formally New York representative of the Internet Of People blockchain platform.
 
 
 
 Richard Nelson - Multiple Patent holding inventor of Solaroof technology.. Former NASA scientist with a focus on closed loop waste regeneration for outer space survival.
 
 
 
 Aubrey Zang, design and chemical consultant with PhD in electrochemistry.
 
 
 
 Daud GeAzan - blockchain enthusiast and Khepera marketing director.
 
 
 
 John L Gray - design, visual artist and co marketing director.
 
 
 
 Shai Hankins - Khepera business management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We have included our presentation from a United Nations event where several representatives from African nation states stated their eagerness to work with us to roll out our ""Bioregeneration For Education"" efforts. They were especially excited by the prospect of educational institutions funding themselves via value(s) derived from student and faculty bioregeneratives. All schools where we deploy our ""Bioregeneration For Education"" program will receive curriculum packages about blockchain and our Bioregenerative Hygiene Micro-Farming methods. While both students and teachers will receive bioregenerative rev shares in crypto. 
 
 
 
 This will further enhance this project as a springboard for mass adoption in the Global South. We have included a video ""white paper"" outlining the tech and our longer term climate mitigation goals. This video also shows that the basic technology for the D-LAV has been successfully vetted by the United States patent office and a U.S. science agency. 
 
 
 
 Khepera DIO's Bioregenerative technologies have also been given the nod by former NASA scientist Mr. Richard Nelson, a multiple patent holder himself who is on the Khepera DIO team."

 This project aims to provide solar-powered pellet stoves and solar panels to families living in the community. Pellet stoves are much more energy-efficient and require far fewer resources than the open wood fires traditionally used for cooking. Having a pellet stove means that family members do not have to walk long distances to gather firewood but can instead use biofuel that's readily available in the community‚Äìeven cow dung or nut shells do the job. This also keeps the larger area from being further deforested. The solar panels provide independent access to renewable energy and can be used to charge the stoves, as well as small appliances such as cell phones and lamps.
 
 
 
 Through a previous Gitcoin grant round, we were able to gift 60 stoves, solar panels, and fruit trees to the community and there's still much more demand. There are still about 140 more families in the community, who could benefit from having a pellet stove and solar panels."

The project leverages cutting-edge concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts to unlock new opportunities in financing forest conservation and rural development.
 
 
 
 [![Treejer-One-Pager-Gitcoin.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ydCQRRvD/Treejer-One-Pager-Gitcoin.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/d7njPhMF)
 
 
 
 Treejer acts as a seamless, transparent bridge empowering local communities through crypto donations even in unbanked and remote areas. Treejer's approach incentivizes not only forest plantation but also conservation by locking up the funds in a smart contract and releasing it over time as planters and other data providers continue providing updates from forest status.
 
 
 
 [![Treejer-Donor-App-Gitcoin.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XvfKTzkv/Treejer-Donor-App-Gitcoin.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/2q5BWTJp)
 
 
 
 The protocol also provides proof-of-impact to donors in the form of dynamic tree NFTs that have real-world attributes. These NFTs are linked to each tree and are minted on Polygon network.
 
 
 
 Treejer protocol has several smart contracts and two main interfaces: a payment and forest tracking interface offered to donors on ""https://treejer.com"" and a dedicated mobile app for tree planters and rural ambassadors. They use it to submit new trees, provide updates and unlock conservation rewards.
